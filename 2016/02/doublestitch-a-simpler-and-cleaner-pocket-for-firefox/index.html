            <p>I love <strong>Pocket</strong> and I love <strong>Firefox</strong>.</p>
<p>But two things were driving me batty about the Pocket feature built into Firefox:</p>
<ol>
<li>The design of the popup experience when you save a page to Pocket is... unfortunate. It stays up far too long, <strong>and</strong> it doesn&#39;t go away when you switch tabs. Yeah, it stays open for a given URL even when you&#39;re on a tab with a completely different URL! But regardless of whether you think that&#39;s as crazy as I do, I never want to add tags so just don&#39;t need it at all.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="screen-shot-2016-02-19-at-11-17-56-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-19 at 11.17.56 AM"></p>
<ol>
<li>The Pocket toolbar button doesn&#39;t indicate whether you&#39;ve already saved the page or not. You have to click the button to figure it out. Now this might not be a problem for everyone. But the way I use my browser can best be described as &quot;tabsplosion&quot;. I don&#39;t know when or where these tabs come from, or how they get there, or whether I saved it already or not. So this tiny piece of ambient visual signal would be useful for me.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I took a couple of hours over the last few evenings and scratched the itch. I made a Firefox add-on which does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adds a new Pocket button to the toolbar. (You can remove the old one by right-clicking it and choosing &quot;Remove from Toolbar&quot;). Mine is red. I want to make one that has nice gold double-stitching on it...</p>
</li>
<li><p>The new button shows a check mark badge when the page is already saved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can click the button to either add or remove the page from Pocket.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No popup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s it. Simple, clear and out of your way.</p>
