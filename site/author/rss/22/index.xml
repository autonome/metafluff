<p>I came here to Apache thinking that I was different, that I had better ideas, that I could shape things on my own, and I continued to think that until very recently... but I look around and see a bunch of people that I care about, a bunch of people that I consider friends, a community of equal individuals, in all possible senses.   </p>
<p>Only when I saw that I knew what to do: delegate, let go, let others step in, let others understand this by themselves (good software comes out as a byproduct of our path to learn it)   </p>
<p>This is my suggestion for all of you, even for you experienced members: delegation scales the community and a bigger community means more value,   </p>
<p>more fun, more positive energy. But delegation happens only if you trust, if you consider your fellow community mate equal to you.   </p>
<p>When this doesn&#39;t happen, friction develops, bottlenecks arise, positive energy turns into negative one.   </p>
<p>Just think about it and return on it often: you are never far enough from your ego to be safe.<a href="">Link</a>  </p>

It&#39;s much more civilized than racial profiling.

The armed forces are always looking to gain decision superiority apparently, and now I want to as well. I think that would be really helpful in most situations.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Another expression used yesterday that I loved came from Cory Doctorow in his &quot;A New Way of Understanding P2P&quot; presentation. He talked about the concept of an imagination proposition, or the idea that people get involved in something simply because it&#39;s interesting. An example he stated was the huge number of people involved in SETI@home vs. P2P projects searching for cures for AIDS or cancer. While the value proposition for an AIDS cure is higher than the search for extraterrestrial life, it&#39;s simply more interesting to people to dedicate their spare CPU cycles to the search for aliens. Imagination proposition.&quot;<a href="">Link</a>  </p>
