Vim.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>AddonEditor is an add-on for Firefox that allows you to use an external editor when building add-ons with the Add-ons Builder (aka Flightdeck). Yeah, say that 10 times fast.</p>
<p>While Skywriter (aka Bespin) is nice, it&#39;s just not [insert your favorite editor here]. So I stole the code from the <a href="http://bit.ly/gZQIiP">Ubiquity project for loading an external app as editor</a>, and converted it to a CommonJS module for Jetpack (which I&#39;ve listed on the <a href="http://mzl.la/aDar20">Jetpack Modules page</a>). I built an add-on using Jetpack&#39;s page-mod module to add buttons to the Add-on Builder for loading a file in an external editor:</p>
<p><a href="addon-editor.png"><img src="http://autonome.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/addon-editor.png" alt="" title="addon-editor"></a></p>
<p>When you click the button the first time, you&#39;re prompted with a file-open dialog. Select the editor application of your choice, and the file will open in it. From then on, your chosen editor will automatically load files when you click the button. To clear your choice, choose the other button.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/eDVYEo">Install AddonEditor</a>. Requires Firefox 4 Beta 7 or newer.</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/idHrqa">Clone and make your own, based on AddonEditor.</a> I built it using  Jetpack 0.10, which isn&#39;t released yet. However, I don&#39;t think it takes advantage of anything new, so it might be test-able from the Builder. But the Builder is giving errors when I hit the &quot;test&quot; button (which I&#39;ve reported to Zalun), so I can&#39;t tell for sure yet.</p>
<p>BEWARE:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve only tested on Linux. Let me know in the comments if it works or doesn&#39;t for you.</li>
<li>Terminal apps not liked, apparently: /usr/bin/vim hangs Firefox completely. /usr/bin/gvim works fine.</li>
<li>The UI augmentation to Flightdeck probably made Zalun puke. It should probably just be an option in the context menu or something. Except that you&#39;d never find it. Ideas?</li>
</ul>

It&#39;s a keystone feature in Firefox - differentiating even now that just about every other browser has some vector for augmentation. However, along with the freedom and power of Firefox extensions comes the ability to slow the browser down. And worse, users and developers have little or no visibility into the causes of poor extension performance.</p>
<p>Not all extensions slow Firefox down. But they can. To prevent that, we need to do three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make it <em>easy</em> for extension developers to keep their extensions fast.</li>
<li>Allow users to see the performance effect of their extensions.</li>
<li>Mitigate the effects of badly-behaving extensions in Firefox itself.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="for-extension-developers">For Extension Developers</h3>
<p>First, we need to loudly and clearly educate extension developers, and provide them tools. Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write an extension performance &quot;best practices&quot; guide on MDC.</li>
<li>Build warnings into Firefox, that highlight code that might perform poorly (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=550242">bug 550242</a>).</li>
<li>Provide a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Build:TryServer">try-server</a> that allows extensions to be uploaded and installed into the test profile.</li>
<li>Perform automated performance testing of extensions upload to AMO (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=458990">bug 458990</a>, maybe?)</li>
<li>Ensure that Jetpack generates extensions that are models for good behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="for-users">For Users</h3>
<p>Users should be able to make informed choices about the extensions they install, and be able to monitor the effect of extensions on their browsing sessions. We could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide performance information for extensions on their pages on AMO.</li>
<li>Build a performance dashboard similar to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=515354">about:memory</a>, but tracking startup time, page-load time, and browser UI behavior such as menu responsiveness. Given a visualization of these things over time, users can see the effects of installing different extensions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="in-the-core">In the Core</h3>
<p>There are also things we can do to mitigate poor performance in core Firefox code. This is being discussed in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=533038">bug 533038</a>.</p>
<p>We&#39;re already working on some of the ideas listed above. Ping me in <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/#startup">#startup on irc.mozilla.org</a> if you want to help out. If you have ideas for other ways to improve extension performance, or to communicate back to users and developers, let me know in the comments.</p>

It was a great experience - a testament to the power of distributed volunteer software development as well as how Firefox as a platform can enable such groups to rapidly build and deploy world-changing tools. As <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/knowmore-blog/?p=86">officially announced on Knowmore.org</a> today, the extension is live! For screenshots and details, check out the <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/index.php?title=KnowMore_Firefox_Extension" title="KnowMore_Firefox_Extension">wiki page</a>, and you can <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7342">install it here</a> (still sandboxed, login is required).</p>
<p>I was first tipped off by <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2008/04/are_you_an_exte.html">Asa Dotzler&#39;s call</a> for extension developers to help out. I didn&#39;t follow up for weeks, as I was busy working on Firefox 3, trying to close up shop for release. Eventually, the smoke started to clear, and I poked <a href="http://www.engagejoe.com/">Joe Solomon</a>, social media extraordinaire, asking where the project was at. The timing was fortuitous: They were sprinting to get the extension ready for <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/">NetSquared 2008</a>. I hopped in, and found that a group of stellar developers already had the building blocks in place. The extension just needed some pieces glued together, and then once the API went live, it was mostly just polish from there on out.</p>
<p>The extension itself acts as a simple lens through which to experience the web, a lens that brings into focus the business and political practices of corporations that you purchase from. How it works is fantastically simple: When you go to a website, Firefox displays a <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/images/e/e1/Americanapparelnotificationbar.png">notification bar at the top of the page</a>, for corporations that have business practices that you might be concerned about, as well as a link to read more. The extension also displays <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/images/e/ef/Americanapparelsearchresults.png">visual notifications in search engine results</a>, marking links to corporations of concern.</p>
<p>This visibility gives us, as web consumers, the power to make informed decisions about where we spend our money, ensuring that we don&#39;t inadvertently fund corporations that behave in a way we find unacceptable.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning, as Knowmore.org <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/index.php?title=Image:Apilogo.jpg" title="Image:Apilogo.jpg">provides an API</a> for accessing the corporate statistics data. I&#39;d love to see mobile interfaces for the site, integration into web video and TV sites, and support for more search engines.</p>
<p>You can help: Knowmore is a wiki! Start <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/index.php?title=Behind_the_Logos" title="Behind_the_Logos">browsing existing corporate data</a>, and you see something missing or incorrect, or you know of another subsidiary, jump in and edit the page.</p>
<p>And if you&#39;re at NetSquared today, it looks like <a href="http://www.numenity.org/blog/2008/05/23/heading-to-netsquared-2008/">Paul Kim</a>, VP of marketing for Mozilla, and some folks from <a href="http://www.getmiro.com">Miro</a> will be there, so say hi!</p>
