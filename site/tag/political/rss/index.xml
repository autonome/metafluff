It was put on by the <a href="http://www.nwcrc.org/">NWCRC</a> and <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/">PFAW</a>, and featured a professor/lawyer, a lawyer handling a case against the government over warrant-less wiretapping, and an activist.</p>
<p>It was f*ckin&#39; scary.</p>
<p>But it was also extremely interesting, and at times even funny. It&#39;s inspiring and humbling to see these smart and talented people out there fighting our government&#39;s encroachments on our rights, on a daily basis. And it&#39;s uplifting to see that it&#39;s possible to keep a sense of humor while doing it... because if we can no longer laugh, then the fascists have truly won.</p>
<p>Yes, you are under surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>DANCE!</strong></p>

During her first week on the job, there was an <a href="http://portland.indymedia.org/en/2006/10/347085.shtml">anti-Bush protest in downtown Portland</a>, that unfortunately turned violent when a group of protesters went off-route and were turned back by police, using pepper spray, rubber bullets and horses. Shauna was on one of the local news channels that night, giving the NWCRC&#39;s comment on what happened:</p>

<p>Clinton Learns a Lesson About Carelessness  </p>
<p>Pages 220-221: While on the road campaigning for Congress against John Paul Hammerschmidt in 1974, Clinton loses five of his students&#39; law-school exams. &quot;I was mortified. I offered the students the option of retaking the exam or getting full credit without a specific grade. They all took the credit, but one of them was particularly upset about it, because she was a good student who probably would have made an A, and because she was a good Republican who had worked for Congressman Hammerschmidt. I don&#39;t think she ever forgave me for losing the exam or for running against her old boss. I sure thought about it when, more than twenty years later, that former student, federal judge Susan Webber Wright, became the presiding judge in the Paula Jones case.&quot;<a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2102786/">Link</a>  </p>
