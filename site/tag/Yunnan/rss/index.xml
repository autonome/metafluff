4/3 A day in Kunming</p>
</li>
<li><p>The gambay lesson was hard learned. Hurty head.</p>
</li>
<li>Electric scooters are silent and everywhere. I&#39;m sure people get hit all the time because they don&#39;t hear them.</li>
<li>The whole city seems quiet and clean. Not Hanoi. Alek says this is a new phenomenon.</li>
<li>Sim card for 15USD. GPRS 500mb 15USD. GPRS is fast here. 3G advertised everywhere in the whole country. Never worked for me though.</li>
<li>Tried to get a camera charger. Guy at cellphone shop called a guy, who delivered it there in 10 minutes. Didn&#39;t work though. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624488710/in/set-72157626489333032">The shop had some great phone brands that&#39;ll look familiar to you</a>.</li>

<li>Needed coffee. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624495172/in/set-72157626489333032">Only could find McDonalds</a>. Sad.</li>

<li>Btw, everyone has these tea containers with a filter of geniusness built-in. I got one. And then lost it.</li>
<li>Went to a big park, where lots of people were outside <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624518602/in/set-72157626489333032">making music</a>, dancing, singing. There were <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623930563/in/set-72157626489333032">cool water toys</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624523504/in/set-72157626489333032">scary dolls</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623932761/in/set-72157626489333032">to ride</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624516602/in/set-72157626489333032">proximity-detecting automated garbage cans</a>.</li>
<li><p>Found a little local joint for dinner. A bunch of the patrons were the musicians from the park. The food was again epic - <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624529052/in/set-72157626489333032/">many kinds of veggie and mushroom dishes, cured pork, soup</a>.
4/4 Zhongdian</p>
</li>
<li><p>Saw what can only be described as &quot;megahousing&quot; developments outside of Kunming.</p>
</li>
<li>Factories everywhere, in suburbs outside the city. Saw a red cloud over a valley of factories. Red.</li>
<li>Oh look, that is a road. On a cliff along the river. How. The. Hell.</li>
<li>Himalayan mountains in the distance? Easily twice as tall as the giant mountains we&#39;re flying over.</li>
<li>Land in Zhongdian. Small airport, but clearly new. Full of Tibetan items, and cold-weather gear. It&#39;s COLD.</li>
<li>One hour flight, landing at 12,000ft above sea-level. Yeah, we all ended up with mild altitude sickness for the first day. That kinda sucked.</li>
<li>Zhongdian was renamed Shangri-La 10 years ago to increase tourism.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615598577/in/set-72157626364130939">Yak fields on the way to town.</a></li>
<li>More Jetta cabs. Must be state-mandated.</li>
<li>Populace is Tibetan mostly, but many other ethnic minorities present.</li>
<li>Pink hat ladies! Scarf tied around hats.</li>
<li>Old town. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615582667/in/set-72157626364130939">Cobblestone streets. Carved wood structures.</a></li>
<li>Fashion for guys is like 80s bad boy. Or black blazer and slacks... for doing manual labor.</li>
<li>Women wearing slave-to-fashion wear, or traditional garb. Not much in between.</li>
<li>Lunch spots advertise with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616165496/in/set-72157626364130939">bao steamers</a>.

<li>Land of no salad. Seriously, there&#39;s almost no fresh vegetables in any food we had the whole trip. Always cooked.</li>
<li>Last day of Cleaning the Grave holiday. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615712971/in/set-72157626364130939">Half the town was in the graveyard</a> as we checked in, lighting off firecrackers by the grave.</li>

<li>Meet Alek&#39;s friend Meow Meow (sp?)</li>
<li>No running water for 4 months during winter because pipes are frozen.</li>
<li>Nightly dancing in both the old-town center, and new-town center. They like to dance.</li>
<li>New hotels in new town. I bet they have heat and running water and power all year round.</li>

4/6 Zhongdian, Tiger Leaping Gorge</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hey, the blankets were quite effective, probably yak wool.</p>
</li>
<li>Bus to Tiger Leaping Gorge.</li>
<li>The hike starts with a nice meandering valley stroll, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613131779/in/set-72157626364149741/">nice views</a>.</li>
<li>Followed by &quot;24 bends&quot;, a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613693186/in/set-72157626364149741/">long series of switchbacks</a>.</li>

<li>Alek has a Chinese name: &quot;Overcoming the power of mugwort&quot;. He&#39;s looking for a new one.</li>
<li>Dinner: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613714688/in/set-72157626364149741/">two mushroom dishes, eggplant, gung pao</a>. Damn.</li>
<li>Alek went into the kitchen and found their house-infused baijiao. One was mushroom. Yes, mushroom liquor. The other was olive, papaya, goji berry... and other stuff. Both were surprisingly good.</li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613138331/in/set-72157626364149741/">Closed it out</a> with biajiao, beer, tea, cards and Snickers.
4/7 Tiger Leaping Gorge to Lijiang</p>
</li>
<li><p>Morning hike out, about 3 hours.</p>
</li>

<li>Alek took a bus out to the main highway to meet his friend, meeting us in Dali in few days.</li>
<li>Shiloh&#39;s feet hurt, so she camped out at Tina&#39;s.</li>

<li>We took a cab to the highway... Alek is there! His bus never came, so he&#39;s coming with us Lijiang.</li>
<li>AWESOME techno remixes of western pop songs the WHOLE way to Lijiang. I sat in front, so had the best view of the 94 times <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618613199/in/set-72157626372735607/">we almost died in head-on collisions</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618575139/in/set-72157626372735607/">The scenery was all rice terraces</a>.

</li>
<li>Before leaving town, went to Black Dragon Pool. Garden, with a pond that reflects Jade Emerald Mountain. Touristy. But <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619586032/in/set-72157626372735607/">nice picture op</a>.</li>
<li>Lunch of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619576950/in/set-72157626372735607/">green beans and fermented bean sauce</a>, the song er mushrooms (song rong?), and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618989793/in/set-72157626372735607/">knife-cut noodles</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619587356/in/set-72157626372735607/">We saw Mao</a>.</li>
<li>Dali bus was 5 hours long. Longer than we expected. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620903140/in/set-72157626377062379">Great</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620310953/in/set-72157626377062379">drive</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620899162/in/set-72157626377062379">though</a>. Except for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643657534/in/set-72157626377062379">nasty cat on a leash</a>.</li>
<li>Checked into a guesthouse, and headed into old-town for dinner. Old-town is huge, and touristy, but way cooler than Lijiang. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620319979/in/set-72157626377062379">Castles, yo</a>.</li>
<li>In Dali, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620905810/in/set-72157626377062379">all the food in a restaurant is kept out front</a>, as advertisement. And <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620318877/in/set-72157626377062379">mushrooms!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620320763/in/set-72157626377062379">More skewers, beer and biajiao</a>.</li>
<li><p>Went for dessert. Heart shaped chocolate cake... on lettuce. Chocolate parfait... with a cherry tomato. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643095799/in/set-72157626377062379">Apple pie, that was a flavorless apple empanada... on lettuce... with strawberry ice cream</a>.
4/9 - Dali</p>
</li>
<li><p>Breakfast of bao, black boiled eggs, baba stuffed with carmel sauce.</p>
</li>
<li>Alec&#39;s out, back to Thailand. All three words of Chinese we know will now be put to the test.</li>
<li>Somehow it&#39;s lunch already. Asparagus, tofu, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620910200/in/set-72157626377062379">emperor oyster mushrooms with dry-cured ham</a>.</li>
<li>Taxi to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620341691/in/set-72157626377062379">the cable car</a>. Hike from cable car to chairlift is too long, canceling that. Saw <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620400239/in/set-72157626377062379">a giant chess set</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621007478/in/set-72157626377062379">a mirror pond</a>.</li>
<li>Taxi to the chairlift that we didn&#39;t hike to. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621012994/in/set-72157626377062379">Beautiful ride</a>. Look down, oh a grave. Oh look, some more. OHHHHH, thousands of them. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621014814/in/set-72157626377062379">Chairlift mountain forest graveyard</a>.</li>
<li>At the top, we hike to the Higherland Inn, only thousands of steep steps up the mountain. Zero view. WTF. Head back down the trail to the restaurant with a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621023462/in/set-72157626377062379">great view</a>. The place has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621020410/in/set-72157626377062379">turtles in a tub</a>... adjacent to all the food that&#39;s on the menu. Hmmm.</li>
<li>I got some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620433931/in/set-72157626377062379">wild mushrooms</a>. Instructions: soak 3 hours, scramble with egg.</li>
<li>Did some shopping in the old city, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620443393/in/set-72157626377062379">got some pasta</a>, and headed back to the hotel to chill.</li>
<li><p>Watched a kung fu movie with lots of flying. Saw a commercial for cleavage pills.
4/10 Dali</p>
</li>
<li><p>Banana pancakes and fresh melon for breakfast. Off to Xishuang for cormorant fishing.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620449007/in/set-72157626377062379">Local market</a>. Saw an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621039100/in/set-72157626377062379">awesome computer store</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620470009/in/set-72157626377062379">Had noodles</a> that were cut off a giant slab that looked like butter. Found the spice they put on the skewers.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620516951/in/set-72157626377062379">Cormorant</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620520205/in/set-72157626377062379/">fishing</a>! <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620521725/in/set-72157626377062379">Rowed</a>. Sang songs.</li>
<li>On the way back, taxi driver took us to the obligatory kickback stop, a marble shop. The Chinese word for marble is &quot;stone from Dali&quot;.</li>
<li>Shiloh chilled at the hotel while <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620528969/in/set-72157626377062379/">we rode bikes to the lake</a>. Stopped at a bakery where they had a &quot;selection of mini sandwiches&quot; on the menu. Turns out the mini sandwiches meant &quot;all sandwiches on the menu, put into one&quot;. Fail.</li>
<li>Before dinner, got a foot massage, where they had us put our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620534137/in/set-72157626377062379">feet in BOILING water</a>.</li>
<li>Shiloh got a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620534623/in/set-72157626377062379">foot steam bath</a>. Shauna: &quot;OK I can smell foot. It smells like a funk dumpling.&quot;</li>
<li>Saw some locals <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621119074/in/set-72157626377062379">smokin&#39; tough</a>.</li>
<li><p>Hunted down the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621124012/in/set-72157626377062379/">wild grilled eggplant for dinner</a> again.
4/11 Back to Kunming</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bus to Kunming. Buses here are cheap, and constantly running. Gotta keep your valuables with you. And there&#39;s no bus stops, just people waiting on the side of the highway.</p>
</li>
<li>Another 5 hours on the road. We passed through <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621127772/in/set-72157626377062379">Mushroom</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621128704/in/set-72157626377062379">Town</a>. And went through multi-mile long tunnels.</li>
<li>Waited a couple of uneventful hours at the airport, spent our last yuan on tea, and flew home.</li>
