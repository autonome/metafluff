Adam&#39;s brother-in-law was interested in learning some cooking technique, so I chose a menu that would cover a lot of different areas. He has the knack for sure, easily flipping a Spanish tortilla even! I had him do most of the actual cooking, with me just directing and drinking the gin and tonics (12 Bridges, PDX REPRESENT YO!).</p>
<p>Tapas</p>
<ul>
<li>yellow tomatoes (from the garden!) with a little salt and roasted paprika sprinkled on top</li>
<li>cubed manchego and fresh mozzarella (yeah, i know, but i like the hard/soft contrast) marinated in olive oil, fresh thyme, basil and chives (all from the garden!), cracked pepper and chili flakes</li>
<li>rainbow carrots lightly pickled in red wine vinegar, garlic (from the garden!), cumin, oregano and olive oil</li>
<li>marcona almonds
Spanish Tortilla</li>
</ul>
<p>I usually prepare this by par-boiling the potatoes, but this time we did it up proper by first frying them in olive oil and garlic and then adding to the egg mixture and moving to the pan... again with much olive oil, to get a real nice crisp to the edge. We added minced serrano ham and fine-diced jalapenos (from the garden!), so it came out with a nice aroma and a bit of kick. We made three pans of it, so I&#39;ve been enjoying it for breakfast ever since ;)</p>
<p>True Cod and Clams in Salsa Verde</p>
<p>Earlier in the afternoon I made a stock with onions, garlic, carrot, some rockfish I had in the freezer, some plum tomatoes (I bet you can guess where from...), mussels, flat-leaf parsley and white pepper. This became the base for a sauce somewhat like zarzuela, but with white wine instead of brandy, so giving the dish more of a high note. The cod was first rubbed-down with salt and white pepper, then lightly floured and fried, and then cooked the rest of the way in the sauce. Then came peas, flat-leaf parsley, and when the fish is about done, we threw in the clams and some mussels. We served this up with a large pile of torn up baguette for soaking up the broth.</p>
<p>After Dinner</p>
<p>I found a dry sherry that was very light, with coloring almost like a chardonnay, called La Gitana. It was crisp and not overly sweet, so paired well with the hot weather. We also had some entirely very dark chocolate that was purportedly from Spain, but I&#39;m betting the beans were not!</p>
<p>We spent a good two hours cooking, and had a great time: no injuries, nor recipe mishaps, and everyone seemed to enjoy the food. In retrospect, I&#39;d probably throw some lemon halves in the stock, and let the fish marinate a little longer, but otherwise everything came out pretty well. It was <em>really</em> fun to have an excuse to cook a big meal, and hang out with fun people, and all on a MONDAY no less!</p>
<p>I got some of the recipes and ideas from <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/0761135553" title="The New Spanish Table">The New Spanish Table</a>, found on Powell&#39;s sale table for $7. It&#39;s a decent cookbook - very accessible recipes, a lot of great tips and background info.</p>

Overall, a fantastic experience. I would go back in a heartbeat, if only my heart (and wallet) could take that kind of a beating regularly.</p>
<p>Soup</p>
<p>The soup was cucumber and creme fraiche, was airy and cool; some citrus high notes with the cucumber keeping things steady. The flower petals were a beautiful contrast. The chili oil was... missing. Others said they could taste it, but I couldn&#39;t. It would&#39;ve provided perfect dissonance, as well as a textural anchor on the tongue, so my <em>hunch</em> is that it was intended to be drizzled on top, but was forgotten. It was paired with a Gruner Veltliner, worked fine.</p>
<p>Charcuterie</p>
<p>Foie gras bon-bon: Unbelievable on the tongue, but a bit too worshipful. I come from peasant stock, and wanted to eat this on some country bread.</p>
<p>Steak tartare and quail egg on toast: Undoubtedly a highlight of the meal. The tartare was supremely cold with maybe some... scallion and white pepper? I had a minor yolk-splosion, so best to take it all in one bite.</p>
<p>Pork Rillette and house cracker: High expections went unmet. The pork was unnassuming, and the cracker could&#39;ve been crisper.</p>
<p>Duck, duck liver, cherry and pistachio pate: A nice blend of creamy and roasty. I&#39;m just not a fan of mixing fruit, nuts <em>and</em> meat, so it wasn&#39;t my favorite. Also, my less-than-blue blood again was begging for bread or a cracker.</p>
<p>There was also a cornichon on a daub of dijon mustard, a crisp &quot;ice leaf&quot; (IIRC) on a sliced pea salad, and a salami.</p>
<p>All of this was paired with Tessier Cheverny Blanc - wonderful choice: front of the tongue, spicy, light.<em> </em></p>
<p>Entree</p>
<p>The  seared duck breast, alongside a cherry and tomato salsa and pan-fried squash blossoms. The duck was fairly unadorned, which was a great move given it&#39;s place in the courses - nice to focus on purity after the charcuterie carnival. The salsa was more of a salad: Rainier cherries and cherry tomatoes halved and in a mild vinegar. It stood up for itself next to the duck.</p>
<p>The only downer of the course was the Grosbois Vielles Chinon that was the paired with it. Maybe they intentionally chose a wine that would get out of the way... or maybe it was just unremarkable. The duck cried out for a saltier, earthy red - I&#39;d have chosen a tempranillo maybe.</p>
<p>Salad</p>
<p>Oddly, this was the simplest part of the meal, yet all agreed that it vied for a top spot among the courses. It was some local greens and a few peach slices in a sherry vinaigrette. There were marcona almonds, but as they were whole, they were bystanders. The upstaging of the course was the shaved goat cheese. The shameless creamy sourness of goat cheese, perfectly distributed via micro-shavings, hooked up with the sherry, and ravished those damn greens. Playing the excited voyeur was the  Salomon Kogl Riesling - light on the tongue and a nice balance to the piquancy of the sherry.</p>
<p>Cheese</p>
<p>Steve&#39;s cheese - one slice each of a sheep, goat and cow cheese, with poached apricots, candied hazelnuts, saffron shortbread and local honeycomb. The sheep&#39;s cheese stood out - with a broad nuttiness, definitely was the best choice to contrast the preceding course. The shortbread were little buttons, well-sized to reign in the saffron&#39;s tendency to dominate. The honeycomb was what really took this course over the edge, into the realm of culinary primality - a chthonic offering spilt on the civilized craftsmanship of the cheeses.</p>
<p>The Prieler pinot blanc was well paired, provided respite for an overstimulated palate.</p>
<p>Dessert</p>
<p>Lemon verbena meringues with buttermilk ice cream and tayberries and blackberries. The meringue was truly enjoyable, bright and sweet. The wine pairing was JJ Christoffel Urziger Wurzgarten Auslese, and was far too thickly sweet to be served with buttermilk ice cream. We were offered coffee, which was the right choice for this course... but then left us with wine and coffee at the same time, which was awkward.</p>
<p>Tips: The portions were perfect, and the progression of courses was well thought out, so I&#39;d recommend going for all six courses. The wine pairing, with a couple of exceptions, was smart, so I recommend that as well. Go for the second seating, as you&#39;ll get more time to linger.</p>
