Other people on the team are also blogging updates on their individual projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ryan Flint: <a href="http://screwedbydesign.com/blog/2009/08/this-week-in-perf-aug14.php">This Week in Perf - Aug. 14th Edition</a></li>
<li>David Dahl: <a href="http://daviddahl.blogspot.com/2009/08/looking-for-dead-code.html">Looking for Dead Code</a></li>
<li>Drew Willcoxon: <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/adw/2009/08/14/startup/">Startup</a>
As usual, for the details, check out the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Projects/Startup_Time_Improvements" title="Startup Improvements wiki">Startup Project wiki page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419893">PGO for SQLite, MozStorage and Places</a>: Landed on the Places branch. The test failures seen when PGO first landed are not there (yay), but the Talos boxes don&#39;t show any clear wins (boo).</li>
<li>Dead Code Hunting: Even though he&#39;s supposed to be on vacation, David has got the full browser.xul environment pulled in for analysis. More info in his post (linked above). Still a lot of false-positives in the detection code.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=480735">Startup timeline</a>: Vlad&#39;s been working with the NSPR owner, and the latest patch has review, so almost there.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=507038">XPCOM component combining</a>: No progress from me, but Florian Qu√®ze <span></span>attached a shell script to knit the components together!</li>
<li>XPT Linking on Mac: Drew has confirmed big wins from this, split it off into it&#39;s <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510309">own bug</a>. More detailed notes from him on his <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Projects/Startup_Time_Improvements/adw_notes">wiki page.</a></li>
<li><p>JARification</p>
<ul>
<li>Taras&#39; <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=504864">core IO improvements to how JAR file contents are read</a> have landed, as well as the <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=468011">combining of all chrome into browser and toolkit JARs</a> (this morning!).</li>
<li>Ryan is looking at putting the components directory into a JAR so that it reaps the same benefits as the chrome directories.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Testing/Measurement</p>
<ul>
<li>Met with Alice to talk about various test scenarios, and the deployment process</li>
<li>Started a guide for <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Testing/Talos/NewTests" title="Creating a new Talos test">taking a Talos test from idea to production</a></li>
<li>Initial steps on automatedly testing cold-startup, figuring out platform-specific calls, and what Talos changes are needed</li>
<li>Discussing approaches to micro-benchmarking the browser UI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Enable PGO on mozilla-central, get nightly tester feedback</li>
<li>Once the startup timeline lands, get an actual timeline to analyze</li>
<li>Reduce false-positives on the dead-code report, document installation and usage, develop plan for continuous integration</li>
<li>Work with Ted to get a patch for JS component combining into the packaging process</li>
<li>Figure out if there&#39;s a win in jar&#39;ing /components or if we just need to fix fastload to not touch the files as much</li>
<li>Get XPT linking landed</li>
<li>File bugs and get the Talos changes in Alice&#39;s queue for cold-startup testing</li>
<li>Finish the Talos test development guide</li>
<li>Talk with Ryan Doherty about the reporting side of microbenchmarking
[UPDATE: added Drew&#39;s blog post]</li>

Per <a href="http://beltzner.ca/mike/2009/08/07/firefox-team-weekly-roundups-planning-sprinting-and-reporting/">Mike Beltzner&#39;s post</a>, we&#39;ll be updating our status weekly. Here&#39;s the status of what the team did this week, as well as pointers to some other work going on. The list here highlights major points, but is not complete. Many more details of these projects, as well as other areas for investigation can be found on the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Sprints/Startup_Time_Improvements">wiki page</a>, and on <a href="http://blog.vlad1.com/">Vlad</a> and <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/tglek/">Taras&#39;</a> blogs.</p>
<p><strong>Status</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=507101">XPCOM component combining</a> (Dietrich): Manually combined a bunch of files, and found improvements in sub 100ms, but varying results, so going to check-in to the Places branch temporarily to get better  numbers. Writing a script to hook into the build system to knit the components together automatically, but need better numbers before going further.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=419893">Enabling PGO for SQLite, mozStorage and Places</a> (Dietrich): Made a patch to re-enable PGO for these, and checked into the Places branch. Currently there are unit tests failing, but they look unrelated. Need to trigger more runs to ensure that&#39;s the case. Performance numbers are not definitive, need more runs to complete.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506128">Dead code  hunting with JSHydra</a> (DDahl): Have basic code for function finding,  making progress on code for building JS context for chrome URIs. (props  for help from taras, humph, jcranmer in #static)</li>
<li>Combining XPT files on Mac (Drew): Potentially significant gain of a few seconds on startup, investigation continuing.</li>
<li><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=480735">Startup Timeline</a> (Vlad, DDahl): This is still in review.</li>
<li><p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=504864">Combining jar files</a> (Taras): This is ready to check-in (again).
<strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p>Confirm numbers for combining JS components, finish script to automate combining, work with Ted to hook it into the packaging process, see if any modules can be combined.</p>
</li>
<li>Find out why tests are failing for PGO and quantify gain/loss when the slow tinderboxen finally report some numbers.</li>
<li>Get the startup timeline reviewed, landed and start adding markers and performing analysis.</li>
<li>Investigate why wall-clock time of combined jars doesn&#39;t decrease.</li>
<li>Get full browser JS context working in JSHydra, write the uncalled-function script, file dead-code bugs, get it plugged into continuous integration on tinderbox.</li>
<li>Get <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=475289">bug 475289</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=499123">bug 499123</a> landed, further reducing IO and component registration time spent at startup.</li>

I previously blogged about the <a href="http://autonome.wordpress.com/2009/05/08/portland-firefox-developers-meetup/">Portland Firefox Developers</a> group that emerged from BarCampPortland 3. However, there was yet another fantastic birthing there: the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/openwebgames">Open Web Games group</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/alainbloch">Alain Bloch</a> scheduled a session called Developing Non-Flash Web-based Games. A bunch of people attended, probably three times what would&#39;ve fit in the room it was supposed to be in, so it was held in a row of cubicles, with most people standing.</p>
<p>It was a great discussion, covering <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTML/Canvas">canvas</a>, <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">Flash</a>, <a href="http://blog.vlad1.com/canvas-3d/">Canvas3D</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/o3d/">O3D</a>, <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a>, <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity-web-player-2.x.html">Unity</a>, <a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>, iPhone gaming, and a lot of talk about existing Web-based games. Check out the <a href="http://2009.barcampportland.com/notes/ene">notes from the session</a> for logs of the talk. There was a lot of interest in building libraries for different gaming models and interactions, to ease the building of games on the Web.</p>
<p>The talk was way too short, and at the end it was clear there was interest in building a proof-of-concept game using canvas and other HTML5 technologies. So to further that effort, and to continue the brainstorming on building games using the open Web, we created the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/openwebgames">OpenWebGames</a> group on Google Groups. Join us in finding ways to make the Web more funnerer than ever!</p>
<p>If you&#39;re coming to the <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/">Open Source Bridge conference</a> in Portland Oregon from June 17-19, the group is getting together to sprint on development of a game at the <a href="http://opensourcebridge.org/wiki/Hacker_Lounge">OSB Hacker Lounge</a>. Even you&#39;re not attending, if you have ideas for a game to sprint on, or want to join in online, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/openwebgames">join the group</a>!</p>

I figured the easiest way to test the streaming myself would be to use the webcam in my MacBook Pro&#39;s built-in iSight camera.</p>
<p>I pinged <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/">Asa</a> to get details about how he streams <a href="http://air.mozilla.com/">Air Mozilla</a>, which brought Icecast into the picture. I found some old posts about using VLC on Linux to capture the external iSight, so tried it... but no dice, the capture module barfed when trying to talk to the camera. VLC ships with a capture module for the iSight, but hasn&#39;t been updated to work with the internal iSight. Bah. VLC also supported transcoding to Ogg Theora, as well as streaming to Icecast servers, so it really seemed like it&#39;d provide just about everything, if it only supported the camera.</p>
<p>I looked up the error I got from VLC, posted on the VLC forums, no answers. So I emailed the author of VLC&#39;s Quicktime module, <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/accounts/pdherbemont">Pierre d&#39;Herbemont</a>, at the email he left in the source file. After a couple of emails, and less than 24 hours later, <a href="http://git.videolan.org/?p=vlc.git;a=commitdiff;h=d032b62bfaada60a4f3e0b3b2a5a71f65bf8eea9">he&#39;d checked in a fix</a>. Open source FTW. Thanks Pierre.</p>
<p>The steps to get it working are enumerated below. At some point, the VLC fix will ship, but until then you&#39;ll need to use nightly builds.</p>
<p>Install and configure the Icecast2 server:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a></li>
<li>In the Terminal: sudo port install icecast2. This installs everything into various dirs in /opt/local.</li>
<li>Edit /opt/local/etc/icecast.xml, set user/group it runs as (for logfiles, i set mine to _www, same as Apache), and change the default passwords in the authentication section.</li>
<li>Set permissions on /opt/local/var/log/icecast to be writable by the user you configured Icecast to run as.</li>
<li>In the Terminal, start the server: sudo icecast -c /opt/local/etc/icecast.xml -b</li>
<li>Test your install by checking the server&#39;s status at <a href="http://localhost:8000/status.xsl">http://localhost:8000/status.xsl</a></li>
<li><p>Watch the log in the Terminal: tail -f opt/local/var/log/icecast/error.log (Useful for confirming VLC access, as well as catching authentication problems)
Start the stream:</p>
</li>
<li><p>Download and install the most recent <a href="http://nightlies.videolan.org/build/macosx-intel/?C=M%3BO=D">VLC nightly build</a></p>
</li>
<li>Open the terminal, and execute the command below</li>
<li>Open <a href="http://localhost:8000/stream/isight">http://localhost:8000/stream/isight</a> with Firefox 3.5b4 (or newer)
VLC Command (all one line):</li>
</ol>
<p>/Applications/VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/VLC qtcapture:// --sout=&quot;#transcode{vcodec=theora,vb=256,venc=theora,acodec=vorbis,ab=64,aenc=vorbis}: standard{access=shout,mux=ogg,dst=source:yourpassword@localhost:8000/stream/isight}&quot;</p>
<p><img src="picture-211.png" alt="screenshot" title="screenshot"></p>
<p>It&#39;s still not quite ready for practical use:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&#39;s still some size distortion, maybe I have the aspect ratio wrong or something</li>
<li>Still working on sound</li>
<li>Lag is pretty bad</li>
</ul>

He works at <a href="http://vidoop.com/">Vidoop</a>, and is the developer of <a href="http://ineedtoreadthis.com/">ineedtoreadthis.com</a>. We were talking at BarCamp about how there&#39;s a lot of Firefox extension development going on, but usually by lone individuals. For instance, many of the extension developers I interact with say the same thing: &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m <em>the</em> person at my company who&#39;s in charge of the extension&quot;. And while there&#39;s a lot of great online resources for extension developers, there&#39;s no local group or meet-up specific to development using the Mozilla platform.</p>
<p>Hence the PDX Firefox Developers Group! If you&#39;re interested in developing Firefox extensions, or hacking Firefox itself, or are already doing so, come out and meet others doing the same. For the first meeting, Ben is going to talk about his <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pdx-firefox-dev/msg/40b71d5ab74c0db9">unit test framework for extensions</a>, and I&#39;m going to talk about <a href="http://ubiquity.mozilla.com/">Ubiquity</a>, a Mozilla Labs project. I&#39;d like it to be more focused on the hacking than lecturing, so bring your laptop! For example, I&#39;ll walk through the process of writing a new Ubiquity command. Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pdx-firefox-dev">PDX-Firefox-Dev Google group</a> for ongoing talk about Firefox and Mozilla hacking, or if you have topics you&#39;d like to talk about at the meet-ups.</p>
<p>The group is meeting on the second Wednesday of the month. The first meeting is next Wednesday, May 13th, and is taking place at <a href="http://www.nedspace.com/">Nedspace</a> (directions below) at 7pm. We&#39;ll probably roll somewhere near for drinks afterwards. Please <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2620820/">RSVP on Upcoming</a>.</p>

In Firefox 2, the default amount of history saved was 9 days, so just over a week. The default in Firefox 3 is 180 days. Or 6 months. Or <em>20 times</em> the amount that Firefox 2 stored. However you slice it, it&#39;s a far greater amount of data than was previously stored. An example benefit is that we can use this set of data to more accurately predict what you&#39;re searching for in the Awesomebar. However, the challenge is to keep the browser <em>fast</em>, at least as fast as if we still only stored 9 days, and not only in the Awesomebar, but everywhere and anywhere that this data is exposed.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox3.5">Firefox 3.5</a> contains a large number of internal changes to how we store, manage and display this data, in order to improve performance. <a href="http://twitter.com/sdwilsh" title="Shawn on Twitter">Shawn Wilsher</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/mak77" title="Marco on Twitter">Marco Bonardo</a> spent an immense amount of time and effort altering almost every SQL query in <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Places">Places</a>, the bookmark and history infrastructure, so that it no longer needs to write to the database every time you visit a page, a project <a href="http://shawnwilsher.com/archives/168">well</a> <a href="http://shawnwilsher.com/archives/169">chronicled</a> <a href="http://shawnwilsher.com/archives/170">on</a> <a href="http://shawnwilsher.com/archives/172">Shawn&#39;s</a> <a href="http://shawnwilsher.com/archives/242">blog</a>.

<p>A recent effort to gather real world usage data is the <a href="https://places-stats.mozilla.com/">Places Statistics project</a>, run by <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/adw/">Drew Willcoxon</a> and <a href="http://daviddahl.blogspot.com/">David Dahl</a>. Drew created a script that culled statistical information about browsing behavior from the database that stores a user&#39;s history and bookmarks. Users who wish to participate can anonymously submit their statistics to a website that aggregates the data. David wrote a Python tool that generates databases based on the aggregate data, that we can use as canonical datasets to test against. One of the first ways we&#39;ll put this data to use is to run our current <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance:Tinderbox_Tests">performance test suite</a> against minimum, average and maximum sized databases generated by this tool.</p>
<p>Firefox will never be fast enough, so the work continues into <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Namoroka">Firefox.next</a>.

It was a great experience - a testament to the power of distributed volunteer software development as well as how Firefox as a platform can enable such groups to rapidly build and deploy world-changing tools.

<p>I was first tipped off by <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2008/04/are_you_an_exte.html">Asa Dotzler&#39;s call</a> for extension developers to help out. I didn&#39;t follow up for weeks, as I was busy working on Firefox 3, trying to close up shop for release. Eventually, the smoke started to clear, and I poked <a href="http://www.engagejoe.com/">Joe Solomon</a>, social media extraordinaire, asking where the project was at. The timing was fortuitous: They were sprinting to get the extension ready for <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/">NetSquared 2008</a>. I hopped in, and found that a group of stellar developers already had the building blocks in place. The extension just needed some pieces glued together, and then once the API went live, it was mostly just polish from there on out.</p>
<p>The extension itself acts as a simple lens through which to experience the web, a lens that brings into focus the business and political practices of corporations that you purchase from. How it works is fantastically simple: When you go to a website, Firefox displays a <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/images/e/e1/Americanapparelnotificationbar.png">notification bar at the top of the page</a>, for corporations that have business practices that you might be concerned about, as well as a link to read more. The extension also displays <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/images/e/ef/Americanapparelsearchresults.png">visual notifications in search engine results</a>, marking links to corporations of concern.</p>
<p>This visibility gives us, as web consumers, the power to make informed decisions about where we spend our money, ensuring that we don&#39;t inadvertently fund corporations that behave in a way we find unacceptable.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning, as Knowmore.org <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/index.php?title=Image:Apilogo.jpg" title="Image:Apilogo.jpg">provides an API</a> for accessing the corporate statistics data.

If was pretty fun, and very different from the development grind of late. Some thoughts about the experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve had my head in the Firefox 3 sand for a <em>long</em> time. Trying.. to remember.. how to.. talk..</li>
<li>SUMO is <em>fantastic</em>. I had no idea what it was until today... and I am ashamed for that.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.djst.org/blog/">David Tenser</a> is truly a gentleman.</li>
<li>Live screen-sharing with audio... worldwide... free... on the web, is a PAIN. We did not accomplish this, and resorted to a phone conference for audio.
It&#39;s nice to be out in society again. Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll even blog more.</li>
</ul>
