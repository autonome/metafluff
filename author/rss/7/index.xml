Overall, a fantastic experience. I would go back in a heartbeat, if only my heart (and wallet) could take that kind of a beating regularly.</p>
<p>Soup</p>
<p>The soup was cucumber and creme fraiche, was airy and cool; some citrus high notes with the cucumber keeping things steady. The flower petals were a beautiful contrast. The chili oil was... missing. Others said they could taste it, but I couldn&#39;t. It would&#39;ve provided perfect dissonance, as well as a textural anchor on the tongue, so my <em>hunch</em> is that it was intended to be drizzled on top, but was forgotten. It was paired with a Gruner Veltliner, worked fine.</p>
<p>Charcuterie</p>
<p>Foie gras bon-bon: Unbelievable on the tongue, but a bit too worshipful. I come from peasant stock, and wanted to eat this on some country bread.</p>
<p>Steak tartare and quail egg on toast: Undoubtedly a highlight of the meal. The tartare was supremely cold with maybe some... scallion and white pepper? I had a minor yolk-splosion, so best to take it all in one bite.</p>
<p>Pork Rillette and house cracker: High expections went unmet. The pork was unnassuming, and the cracker could&#39;ve been crisper.</p>
<p>Duck, duck liver, cherry and pistachio pate: A nice blend of creamy and roasty. I&#39;m just not a fan of mixing fruit, nuts <em>and</em> meat, so it wasn&#39;t my favorite. Also, my less-than-blue blood again was begging for bread or a cracker.</p>
<p>There was also a cornichon on a daub of dijon mustard, a crisp &quot;ice leaf&quot; (IIRC) on a sliced pea salad, and a salami.</p>
<p>All of this was paired with Tessier Cheverny Blanc - wonderful choice: front of the tongue, spicy, light.<em> </em></p>
<p>Entree</p>
<p>The  seared duck breast, alongside a cherry and tomato salsa and pan-fried squash blossoms. The duck was fairly unadorned, which was a great move given it&#39;s place in the courses - nice to focus on purity after the charcuterie carnival. The salsa was more of a salad: Rainier cherries and cherry tomatoes halved and in a mild vinegar. It stood up for itself next to the duck.</p>
<p>The only downer of the course was the Grosbois Vielles Chinon that was the paired with it. Maybe they intentionally chose a wine that would get out of the way... or maybe it was just unremarkable. The duck cried out for a saltier, earthy red - I&#39;d have chosen a tempranillo maybe.</p>
<p>Salad</p>
<p>Oddly, this was the simplest part of the meal, yet all agreed that it vied for a top spot among the courses. It was some local greens and a few peach slices in a sherry vinaigrette. There were marcona almonds, but as they were whole, they were bystanders. The upstaging of the course was the shaved goat cheese. The shameless creamy sourness of goat cheese, perfectly distributed via micro-shavings, hooked up with the sherry, and ravished those damn greens. Playing the excited voyeur was the  Salomon Kogl Riesling - light on the tongue and a nice balance to the piquancy of the sherry.</p>
<p>Cheese</p>
<p>Steve&#39;s cheese - one slice each of a sheep, goat and cow cheese, with poached apricots, candied hazelnuts, saffron shortbread and local honeycomb. The sheep&#39;s cheese stood out - with a broad nuttiness, definitely was the best choice to contrast the preceding course. The shortbread were little buttons, well-sized to reign in the saffron&#39;s tendency to dominate. The honeycomb was what really took this course over the edge, into the realm of culinary primality - a chthonic offering spilt on the civilized craftsmanship of the cheeses.</p>
<p>The Prieler pinot blanc was well paired, provided respite for an overstimulated palate.</p>
<p>Dessert</p>
<p>Lemon verbena meringues with buttermilk ice cream and tayberries and blackberries. The meringue was truly enjoyable, bright and sweet. The wine pairing was JJ Christoffel Urziger Wurzgarten Auslese, and was far too thickly sweet to be served with buttermilk ice cream. We were offered coffee, which was the right choice for this course... but then left us with wine and coffee at the same time, which was awkward.</p>
<p>Tips: The portions were perfect, and the progression of courses was well thought out, so I&#39;d recommend going for all six courses. The wine pairing, with a couple of exceptions, was smart, so I recommend that as well. Go for the second seating, as you&#39;ll get more time to linger.</p>

It was a great experience - a testament to the power of distributed volunteer software development as well as how Firefox as a platform can enable such groups to rapidly build and deploy world-changing tools. As <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/knowmore-blog/?p=86">officially announced on Knowmore.org</a> today, the extension is live! For screenshots and details, check out the <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/index.php?title=KnowMore_Firefox_Extension" title="KnowMore_Firefox_Extension">wiki page</a>, and you can <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7342">install it here</a> (still sandboxed, login is required).</p>
<p>I was first tipped off by <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2008/04/are_you_an_exte.html">Asa Dotzler&#39;s call</a> for extension developers to help out. I didn&#39;t follow up for weeks, as I was busy working on Firefox 3, trying to close up shop for release. Eventually, the smoke started to clear, and I poked <a href="http://www.engagejoe.com/">Joe Solomon</a>, social media extraordinaire, asking where the project was at. The timing was fortuitous: They were sprinting to get the extension ready for <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/">NetSquared 2008</a>. I hopped in, and found that a group of stellar developers already had the building blocks in place. The extension just needed some pieces glued together, and then once the API went live, it was mostly just polish from there on out.</p>
<p>The extension itself acts as a simple lens through which to experience the web, a lens that brings into focus the business and political practices of corporations that you purchase from. How it works is fantastically simple: When you go to a website, Firefox displays a <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/images/e/e1/Americanapparelnotificationbar.png">notification bar at the top of the page</a>, for corporations that have business practices that you might be concerned about, as well as a link to read more. The extension also displays <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/images/e/ef/Americanapparelsearchresults.png">visual notifications in search engine results</a>, marking links to corporations of concern.</p>
<p>This visibility gives us, as web consumers, the power to make informed decisions about where we spend our money, ensuring that we don&#39;t inadvertently fund corporations that behave in a way we find unacceptable.</p>
<p>This is just the beginning, as Knowmore.org <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/index.php?title=Image:Apilogo.jpg" title="Image:Apilogo.jpg">provides an API</a> for accessing the corporate statistics data. I&#39;d love to see mobile interfaces for the site, integration into web video and TV sites, and support for more search engines.</p>
<p>You can help: Knowmore is a wiki! Start <a href="http://www.knowmore.org/wiki/index.php?title=Behind_the_Logos" title="Behind_the_Logos">browsing existing corporate data</a>, and you see something missing or incorrect, or you know of another subsidiary, jump in and edit the page.</p>
<p>And if you&#39;re at NetSquared today, it looks like <a href="http://www.numenity.org/blog/2008/05/23/heading-to-netsquared-2008/">Paul Kim</a>, VP of marketing for Mozilla, and some folks from <a href="http://www.getmiro.com">Miro</a> will be there, so say hi!</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve had my head in the Firefox 3 sand for a <em>long</em> time. Trying.. to remember.. how to.. talk..</li>
<li>SUMO is <em>fantastic</em>. I had no idea what it was until today... and I am ashamed for that.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.djst.org/blog/">David Tenser</a> is truly a gentleman.</li>
<li>Live screen-sharing with audio... worldwide... free... on the web, is a PAIN. We did not accomplish this, and resorted to a phone conference for audio.
It&#39;s nice to be out in society again. Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll even blog more.</li>

And in the wonderment of this new visiblity, <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/">Rob Sayre</a> and <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/brendan/">Brendan Gregg</a> noticed that <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Session_Restore">Session Restore</a> was responsible for a significant portion of <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance:Tinderbox_Tests#Tp.2C_Tp2_and_the_Pageloader_extension:_Page_load_time">page-load</a> time! (/me takes an anxious bow, and dodges the tomatoes)</p>
<p>There are a couple of opportunities for improvement, chronicled <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=398807">here</a>. The first approach we&#39;re trying out is to save and restore less back-history for each tab. Easy to implement, but it wasn&#39;t the first choice since it decreased the utility of the feature... or so we thought, until <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/metrics">Alex Polvi</a> <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=398807#c45">provided some data</a> indicating that users very rarely go back further than 6 steps.</p>
<p>The change that landed today will reduce saving of back-history to 10 pages, from a default of 50. You can set the browser.sessionstore.max_tab_back_history pref to -1 if you want all tab history restored.</p>
<p>Comment on the bug if you&#39;re one of the &lt;1% who go back beyond 10, and are truly disgruntled about this change. Or better yet, fix my patch to cache tab history :)</p>

9:15 Dietrich: and uses a &quot;frecency&quot; algorithm to bubble up stuff
9:15 argyle: nice
9:15 argyle: me like that
9:15 Dietrich: also shows bookmarked and tagged icons in the dropdown
9:15 Dietrich: i&#39;m serious: i can&#39;t use fx2
9:15 Dietrich: because of the url bar changes alone
9:16 Dietrich: it&#39;s sooo painful to live without
9:16 Dietrich: that and turning autofill on == dope
9:17 argyle: I shall play with your little fox
9:17 argyle: oh feature request... on camino when I download something it has a &quot;SHOW&quot; button that opens finder to that folder and selects that file

I have a &quot;daily&quot; folder for feeds that I really need to keep up on, and everything else is filed away into about 20 other content-specific folders.</p>
<p>However, I realized that I only read the &quot;daily&quot; folder, and never look in any of the other folders. Ever. And I&#39;m continually paring down the contents of the &quot;daily&quot; folder, as I don&#39;t have time to keep up with those either.</p>
<p>In fact, I&#39;d stopped reading about music, food, art, design, inventions, <a href="http://www.gadget-madness.net/">gadgets</a>, <a href="http://www.clubmogames.com">free mobile games</a>, travel.</p>
<p>In the end, I was basically reading <a href="http://planet.mozilla.org">Planet Mozilla</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Special:Recentchanges">Mozilla wiki&#39;s &quot;recent changes&quot;</a>. And while I love Moz, that&#39;s a far too singular lens through which to vicariously experience life.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m going for the &quot;river of news&quot; strategy: I&#39;ve moved all feeds into the root folder, and will prune from there. I&#39;ve hidden the folder tree (which I wasn&#39;t using anyway), which leaves more real estate for content. I&#39;ve interspersed my work with my play feeds, which will hopefully bring some variety into my digital walkabouts.</p>
<p>I have a followup task: to step away from the computer altogether at some point.</p>
<p>Ack, almost forgot about the &quot;entropy&quot; part of this post! While pruning feeds, I noticed that a bunch hadn&#39;t had any posts in a while. I checked out a few, and found that the feed URL had changed, but the author hadn&#39;t set up redirects, or published any notice at all on the feed. Lame.</p>
