<p>I&#39;ve got a Firefox profile with 1691 tabs.</p>
<p>I started trying to write down why, but gave up for now. It was becoming an overly long exploration of product design and the future of the web.</p>
<p>It&#39;s Friday. Let&#39;s keep things simple.</p>
<p>As you would expect, Firefox handled this profile quite poorly for a long time. I got used to multi-minute startup time, waiting 15-30 seconds for tabs from external apps to show up, and all manner of non-responsive behavio(u)r.</p>
<p>And then, quite recently, everything changed.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-flow">Quantum Flow</h2>
<p>Right now, more effort is being put into making Firefox fast than I&#39;ve seen since... well, since I&#39;ve been working on Firefox. And I&#39;ve been at Mozilla for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Part of this effort is a project called Quantum Flow - a bunch of engineers making changes that directly impact Firefox responsiveness. To learn more and follow along with these efforts, read <a href="https://ehsanakhgari.org/tag/quantumflow">Ehsan Akhgari&#39;s weekly posts</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of the improvement in this particular scenario is from Kevin Jones&#39; work on bringing the overall cost of unloaded tabs as close to zero as possible. While the major work has landed, the work continues in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=906076">Bug 906076</a>. Huge amounts of thanks for the recent wins for us pathological tab hoarders go to Kevin, DÃ£o Gottwald, Mike de Boer, Tim Taubert, David Teller, Mike Conley, and Gijs Kruitbosch.</p>
<h2 id="test-scenario">Test Scenario</h2>
<p>I took my 1691 tab browser profile, and did a wall-clock measurement of start-up time and memory use for Firefox versions 20, 30, 40, and 50 through 56.</p>
<p>These are my personal results. You might not get the same results. If you test 1691 (or even 1692) tabs and find something totally different, I&#39;d love to hear about it.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I shut down most things on my Macbook (yeah the little one that&#39;s more like a glorified iPad).</p>
</li>
<li><p>I turned off wifi. This is a measurement of Firefox, not the network, nor web page rendering.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I measured by eyeball, using &quot;time cat&quot; on the command line. This might seem weird, but c&#39;mon - I&#39;m measuring <em>minutes</em>. Microsecond precision is not required.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I measured startup time five times, dropping highs and lows. Even that wasn&#39;t really necessary - the times were <em>startingly consistent</em>. With almost 1700 tabs and &gt;5 minute startup, the standard deviation was negligible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For measuring startup time, I killed the timer when the &quot;server not found&quot; page finished being rendered in the active tab. After lots of testing, I consistently found this to be the point at which the application as a whole became responsive and usable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For memory, I waited for one minute after the startup measurement point and then grabbed the total value from the bottom of about:memory. I waited one minute, because I observed a consistent spike in memory after startup which went away within the first minute and then stabilized for a long period after. It&#39;s all kinds of initialization that doesn&#39;t need to block the app from starting, but needs to happen once you get to browsing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I tested Firefox versions 20, 30, 40, and 50 through 56. I tried testing Firefox 10 but it permahung while loading the profile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="start-up-time">Start-up Time</h2>
<p>Graph of startup time with 1691 tabs across Firefox versions 20, 30, 40 and 50 - 56:</p>
<p><img src="startup.png" alt="Startup time"></p>
<p>It&#39;s interesting that Firefox startup time got consistently <em>worse</em> over time until Firefox 51. It&#39;d be interesting to do this test with varying numbers of tabs and find out at what point these types of regressions become noticeable.</p>
<h2 id="memory-usage">Memory Usage</h2>
<p>Graph of memory use one minute after startup with 1691 tabs across Firefox versions 20, 30, 40 and 50 - 56:</p>

<p>The efforts that the Firefox and Gecko and Servo teams are putting into making a SUPERFUCKINGFAST browser are having a real impact, and that&#39;s exciting to see.</p>
