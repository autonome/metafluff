            <p>Alas, I was tagged by <a href="http://www.beltzner.ca/mike/archives/2009/01/meme-too.html" title="Cap">Beltzner</a>, so must break my new year&#39;s resolution to not blog in 2009*. Thanks Mike. Seven things you may know about me, or not:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have three nipples. Of these, zero produce milk.</li>
<li>I was a barista and a chef for many years before owning a computer.</li>
<li>I can juggle. Balls. Clubs. Machetes. Torches. (Listed in descending order of skill-level and recency.)</li>
<li>Some years ago, on the night before we moved from Seattle to Florida, someone stole our fully-packed truck and U-Haul, leaving us with nothing but the pajamas we were wearing, and a goldfish. It was a lesson in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence">impermanence</a>.</li>
<li>I used to play the accordion, and was briefly in a band called Apolkalypse.</li>
<li>One summer, I hitchhiked through 30 states with a friend. You&#39;ve not truly seen America until it throws garbage at you from it&#39;s car.</li>
<li><p>I flew out of a rapidly moving Volkswagen bus when I was 8 years old, and landed on my head. I know what you&#39;re thinking, and yes, you&#39;re probably right.
Seven from me, seven to you:</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="http://shawnwilsher.com/">Sdwilsh</a>. It&#39;s all business on your blog, but <a href="http://quotes.burntelectrons.org/search?query=tag%3Asdwilsh&amp;start=10">your quotes</a> are on fire.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.sandmill.org/">Thunder</a>, the Venezuelan ramen-lover. (Definitely a character in my novel. If I was writing one.)</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/joshayala">Josh</a>. I thought <a href="http://www.badempire.com/">your blog was dead</a>, but then I found the <a href="http://josh.badempire.com/">tumble</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/jvh">Jeff</a>, you don&#39;t blog, afaik. You should tweet seven things and seven people!</li>
<li><a href="http://bowiesdive.blogspot.com/">Bowie</a>. Kid, you&#39;re almost one full year old. Introduce yourself.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.litfuel.net/plush/">James Earl Plush</a>. Eagles? Beagles? Twins? Coincidence? I think not!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.bobanddavid.com/david.html">David Cross</a>. (Aim high, right?)</li>
<li>I&#39;ve been <a href="http://dietrich.tumblr.com/">tumbling</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/dietrich">tweeting</a> regularly, so I kinda already broke my resolution.</li>
