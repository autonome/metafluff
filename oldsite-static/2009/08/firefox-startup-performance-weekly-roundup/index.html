            <p>The Firefox and Platform teams were both onsite at the Mountain View office this week, getting some face-to-face time. There was a lot of great conversation and productive interaction between groups. The team of people focusing on application startup time went over all <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=sw:[ts]">the bugs marked [ts]</a>, discussing and prioritizing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Startup Timeline: While the timeline hasn&#39;t landed yet, you can still take advantage of it: David Dahl has an instrumented build, and will provide timeline info for you if you have an area you want to know about. More details on <a href="http://daviddahl.blogspot.com/2009/08/functiontimertimeline-update.html">his post</a>.</li>
<li>PGO for Places, mozStorage and SQLite: Still blocking on Rel-Eng fixing <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=486783">bug 486783</a>. I need to connect with John O&#39;Duinn and see if we can move this up in the schedule.</li>
<li>JAR Transition: Taras landed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=508421">bug 508421</a> which allows anything in jar:toolkit.jar!/res/* to be loaded via resource://gre-resources/. This makes it very easy to move individual files into a jar, and access them in a fairly transparent way from code. This helps cold startup, as well as page-load time. He <a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/tglek/2009/08/27/moving-files-into-jars/">posted a HOWTO</a> for taking advantage of this.</li>
<li>JS Component Combining: No progress this week.</li>
<li>Static Analysis: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506128">Bug 506128</a> is wrapping up. David need to file a bug with the final log of named-yet-uncalled functions.</li>
<li>Dirty Profile Testing: No progress. Need to list scenarios, file bugs for each, generate Talos config patches and profile data, and then move it into Rel-Eng territory. Also, need to get a separate Tinderbox tree, since it&#39;s going to cause a bazillion new columns.</li>
<li>Cold Startup Testing: Drew Willcoxon is working on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=510587">bug 510587</a>, to create a new Ts that measures cold startup. He&#39;s got patches up for adding head/tail file support to Talos. A new issue that cropped up this week is that the simulated cold-startup methods on Windows don&#39;t appear to work very well, so he&#39;s looking for advice there, as well as looking into reboot support in Talos.</li>
<li><a href="http://wagerlabs.com/">Joel Reymont</a> noticed that Safari&#39;s libs are loaded from the OS&#39;s warm cache, and ours are not! In<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513076"> bug 513076</a> he&#39;s investigating whether or not we can get our dynamic libraries in there as well.</li>
<li>Ryan Flint started looking into taking NSS and spellcheck initialization out of the startup path, and found that Shark says they&#39;re not in it on a regular startup! However, I found a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=511515">recent bug from Vlad</a> talking about crazy stuff NSS does at startup (aside from the temp file dir skullduggery), so need to figure out how he&#39;s seeing that, and why Shark isn&#39;t.</li>
<li>CSS Parsing Time: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91242">Bug 91242</a> says CSS parsing is 5.5% of startup time... in 2001. Taras has mentioned several times that it&#39;s still significant, so asked him for numbers for contemporary builds. <a href="http://zwol.livejournal.com/">Zack Weinberg</a> is working on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=513149">speeding up parsing using a machine generated lexer</a>, need to get numbers from him on what kind of a difference it makes in parse time.
And if you haven&#39;t yet, read through<a href="http://blog.mozilla.com/tglek/2009/08/20/cleaning-up-startup-disk-io/"> Taras&#39; annotated log of files opened at startup</a>. If you see anything that can be delayed, or want to dig into why a certain file is loaded, let me know! Or just file a bug and put &quot;[ts]&quot; in the bug&#39;s status whiteboard.</li>
