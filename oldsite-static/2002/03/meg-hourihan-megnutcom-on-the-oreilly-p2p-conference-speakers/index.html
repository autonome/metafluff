<p>&quot;Another expression used yesterday that I loved came from Cory Doctorow in his &quot;A New Way of Understanding P2P&quot; presentation. He talked about the concept of an imagination proposition, or the idea that people get involved in something simply because it&#39;s interesting. An example he stated was the huge number of people involved in SETI@home vs. P2P projects searching for cures for AIDS or cancer. While the value proposition for an AIDS cure is higher than the search for extraterrestrial life, it&#39;s simply more interesting to people to dedicate their spare CPU cycles to the search for aliens. Imagination proposition.&quot;<a href="">Link</a>  </p>
