            <p>Last night we went to a panel discussion on the Bush administration&#39;s warrant-less wiretapping program, at <a href="http://www.pdx.edu/">PSU</a> in downtown Portland. It was put on by the <a href="http://www.nwcrc.org/">NWCRC</a> and <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/">PFAW</a>, and featured a professor/lawyer, a lawyer handling a case against the government over warrant-less wiretapping, and an activist.</p>
<p>It was f*ckin&#39; scary.</p>
<p>But it was also extremely interesting, and at times even funny. It&#39;s inspiring and humbling to see these smart and talented people out there fighting our government&#39;s encroachments on our rights, on a daily basis. And it&#39;s uplifting to see that it&#39;s possible to keep a sense of humor while doing it... because if we can no longer laugh, then the fascists have truly won.</p>
<p>Yes, you are under surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>DANCE!</strong></p>
