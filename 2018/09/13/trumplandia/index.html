<p>Meet Gordon Sondland, who <a href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2017/04/21/report-portland-hotel-owner-covertly-steered-cash-to-trump/">donated $1,000,000 for Donald Trump inauguration parties</a>, and has received the ambassadorship to the EU. Read more about him on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Sondland">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>He&#39;s the founder and CEO of <a href="https://provenancehotels.com/who-we-are">Provenance Hotels</a>, a company that owns a group of hotels in the Pacific Northwest, and a few other places around the country..</p>
<p>I started to make a list of these hotels, so I could recommend to people to stay elsewhere. While reading the Provenance website, I found this page:</p>
<p><img src="coconspirators.png" style="max-width: 600px;"></p>
<p>Whoa. These are some of the most successful names in Portland independent businesses. These are the people who make the things I love, and the spaces and menus I enjoy on a Friday night. What the fuck.</p>
<p>The Provenance website lists these <a href="https://provenancehotels.com/co-conspirators">&quot;co-conspirators&quot;</a> (their words, not mine... but apt!) in Portland.</p>
<p>I know these businesses aren&#39;t evil. But I believe that the world around us is constructed by the decisions we make. So I cannot support these businesses while they partner with Provenance Hotel group and Gordon Sondland.</p>
<p>Please support these businesses by letting them know your concern about the part they play in enriching the people that keep Trump in power, and support a civil society  by spending your money elsewhere until they&#39;ve stopped doing business with Provenance.</p>
