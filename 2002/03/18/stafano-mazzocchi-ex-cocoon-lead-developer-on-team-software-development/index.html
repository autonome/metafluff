      <p>A wise man once said: &quot;only when you think everyone is equal to you, you become different&quot;</p>
<p>I came here to Apache thinking that I was different, that I had better ideas, that I could shape things on my own, and I continued to think that until very recently... but I look around and see a bunch of people that I care about, a bunch of people that I consider friends, a community of equal individuals, in all possible senses.</p>
<p>Only when I saw that I knew what to do: delegate, let go, let others step in, let others understand this by themselves (good software comes out as a byproduct of our path to learn it)</p>
<p>This is my suggestion for all of you, even for you experienced members: delegation scales the community and a bigger community means more value,</p>
<p>more fun, more positive energy. But delegation happens only if you trust, if you consider your fellow community mate equal to you.</p>
<p>When this doesn't happen, friction develops, bottlenecks arise, positive energy turns into negative one.</p>
<p>Just think about it and return on it often: you are never far enough from your ego to be safe.<a href="">Link</a></p>
