NuSOAP is a rewrite of SOAPx4, provided by [NuSphere](http://www.nusphere.com).  

    NuSOAP  is a group of PHP classes that allow developers to create and consume SOAP web services.  

    It does not require any special PHP extensions, which makes it usable by all PHP developers, regardless of ISP, server or platform.  

    Beware, I haven't gotten usage of PHPDoc quite right, so the API docs are a bit wonky at this point.  

    NuSOAP is licensed under the LGPL.  

To download the NuSOAP preview, click [here](/download.php?url=/nusoap/downloads/nusoap-0.6.zip). <p>NuSOAP will be distributed with [NuSphere's PHPEd 3.0](http://www.nusphere.com), along with a wizard that generates PHP code for client web service operations using NuSOAP. Any questions? [Email](mailto:dietrich@ganx4.com) me.<p>Features:
