"Folding paper money (or "money origami") is my one true creative output. My best original [designs](http://www.interior-tips.com) include spiders, eyeglasses, sailboats, and framed portraits. I got started in high school when I learned how to make a ring out of a dollar bill. I generally make these items to leave as tips."[Link](http://www.umva.com/~clay/money/index.html)
