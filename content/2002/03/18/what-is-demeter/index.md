"An important concept of Demeter is to split software   

into at least two parts: The first part defines the objects.    

The second part defines the operations.  The goal of   

Demeter is to maintain a loose coupling between the   

objects and the operations, so that one can   

make modifications to either without serious impact   

on the other.  This cuts down significantly on   

maintenance time."[Link]()
