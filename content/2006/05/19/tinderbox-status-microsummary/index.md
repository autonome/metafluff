The point at which I regressed browser startup time in the Firefox 2 Alpha 2 was about the same point at which I started keeping a very keen eye on [Tinderbox](http://tinderbox.mozilla.org). Thus, a Tinderbox status Microsummary! [Microsummaries](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Microsummaries) are a hot new feature in Firefox 2 - basically a bookmark with a label that periodically updates. This Tinderbox Microsummary will show "OK" or "\{\#\} Burning (\{hostnames\})" for the tree that you bookmark. Support for orange trees is not there yet.

You can install it [here](http://dietrich.ganx4.com/mozilla/tinderbox-microsummary.xml).

Also, here's a snippet of [XSL](http://dietrich.ganx4.com/mozilla/microsummary.xsl) for allowing your generators to display themselves, as they traipse about the internets.
