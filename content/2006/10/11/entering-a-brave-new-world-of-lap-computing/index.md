This software cocktail cooled my MacBook Pro by more than 40 degrees Fahrenheit:

1.  Install the [MiniStat2 Dashboard widget](http://shockwidgets.com/ministat2update1.8.htm). It shows CPU temperature as well as fan speed. This allows you to do easy before/after verification.
2.  Install [SleepWatcher,](http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/) which executes commands at wake/sleep events.
3.  Finally, install [FanSpeed](http://members.optusnet.com.au/a1291762/2006/10/changing-fan-speed-to-beat-heat.html), which increases the minimum fan speed.

Before: 132F
After: 84F

There are downsides (noticeable fan sound, uses more power), but having a laptop that I can have in my lap is well worth it.
