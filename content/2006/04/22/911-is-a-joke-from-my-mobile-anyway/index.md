This morning a guy fell off his bike in front of our house. He had his dog on a leash, and it looked like the dog or leash had gotten tangled in the bike. He wasn't wearing a helmet. Blood ran from his head, almost down to the gutter, about 6 feet.

I grabbed my phone and ran out of the house when I heard a woman screaming for someone to call 911. After a glimpse at the scene out front,  I ran back in for a towel. While doing this, I called 911. I heard a voice answer, and I started to explain the situation. Almost immediately I noticed that the voice was still talking. It was a recording. I believe the recording said something about dialing more numbers to *really* get 911. But I'm not sure. As soon as I realized it was a recording, I chucked the phone, while running back outside to try to keep this guy's brains where they belong.

WTF. I wonder if that recording I heard was from 911, or from my phone company, T-[Mobile](http://www.phone-movies.org). Either way, people could die because of crap like that.

A few other observations:

*   Head wounds bleed a lot of very thick blood.
*   Firefighters and EMTs walk very slowly, even in the presence of lots of very thick blood.
*   To clean up large amounts of blood, the EMTs use a special disinfectant that looks a bit like cat litter. They said to not hose the area down until it had sat for a few hours. However, a car drove by a few seconds later, leaving a trail of it down our street.
*   The dog shat itself because of the accident. Or it shat itself, causing the accident. Either way, it smelled really bad. (Can you tell I'm not a dog person?)
*   My wife is paralyzed by the sight of blood. If this happens to me, and she's the only one around, I'm S.O.L.
*   Note to self: Wear a friggin helmet.
