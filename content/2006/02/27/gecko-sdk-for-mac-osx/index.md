Much thanks to [Neil Deakin](http://www.xulplanet.com/ndeakin/), who commented on my previous post with a pointer to the [Gecko SDK](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Gecko:SDK). The Gecko SDK allows developers to compile XPIDL typelibs without having to fetch and build the Mozilla source tree. However, as usual there is no Mac version :P

I've zipped up my copy and put it [here](http://dietrich.ganx4.com/mozilla/). Compiled from the 1.8 tree, on OSX 10.4.5.

Thanks to [Alex Sirota](http://www.iosart.com/firefox/gecko-sdk-macosx/) for his helpful instructions for building a standalone SDK for OSX.

Also, I've moved the [JS XPCOM "Hello World" tutorial](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/How_to_Build_an_XPCOM_Component_in_Javascript) to the [Mozilla Developer Center](http://developer.mozilla.org/), and  updated it to use the SDK instead of building from the source.

UPDATE: This evening, the surge of immense pain brought on by the masochistic activity known as "jogging" caused this thought to arise: "Oh shit. Are there any licensing issues with having some Mozilla binaries posted here?"
