Today, I hosted a workshop on bookmarks, tagging and history for [Firefox Support Day](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Support+Firefox+Day)! If was pretty fun, and very different from the development grind of late. Some thoughts about the experience:

*   I've had my head in the Firefox 3 sand for a *long* time. Trying.. to remember.. how to.. talk..
*   SUMO is *fantastic*. I had no idea what it was until today... and I am ashamed for that.
*   [David Tenser](http://www.djst.org/blog/) is truly a gentleman.
*   Live screen-sharing with audio... worldwide... free... on the web, is a PAIN. We did not accomplish this, and resorted to a phone conference for audio.
It's nice to be out in society again. Who knows, maybe I'll even blog more.
