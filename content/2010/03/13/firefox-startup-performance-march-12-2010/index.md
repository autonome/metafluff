No update on the ongoing code projects this week. However, we investigated the extension performance work I mentioned [last week](http://autonome.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/firefox-startup-performance-march-5-2010/), and got a conversation going, with posts by [Taras](http://blog.mozilla.com/tglek/2010/03/11/extensions-startup/), [Asa](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/archives/2010/03/startup_penalty_repo.html) and [myself](http://autonome.wordpress.com/2010/03/10/firefox-extensions-and-performance/). I've listed the various ideas and approaches that came out of those posts and comments [here](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Performance/Addons).
