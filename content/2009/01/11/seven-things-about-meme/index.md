Alas, I was tagged by [Beltzner](http://www.beltzner.ca/mike/archives/2009/01/meme-too.html "Cap"), so must break my new year's resolution to not blog in 2009*. Thanks Mike. Seven things you may know about me, or not:

1.  I have three nipples. Of these, zero produce milk.
2.  I was a barista and a chef for many years before owning a computer.
3.  I can juggle. Balls. Clubs. Machetes. Torches. (Listed in descending order of skill-level and recency.)
4.  Some years ago, on the night before we moved from Seattle to Florida, someone stole our fully-packed truck and U-Haul, leaving us with nothing but the pajamas we were wearing, and a goldfish. It was a lesson in [impermanence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impermanence).
5.  I used to play the accordion, and was briefly in a band called Apolkalypse.
6.  One summer, I hitchhiked through 30 states with a friend. You've not truly seen America until it throws garbage at you from it's car.
7.  I flew out of a rapidly moving Volkswagen bus when I was 8 years old, and landed on my head. I know what you're thinking, and yes, you're probably right.
Seven from me, seven to you:

1.  [Sdwilsh](http://shawnwilsher.com/). It's all business on your blog, but [your quotes](http://quotes.burntelectrons.org/search?query=tag\%3Asdwilsh&start=10) are on fire.
2.  [Thunder](http://blog.sandmill.org/), the Venezuelan ramen-lover. (Definitely a character in my novel. If I was writing one.)
3.  [Josh](http://twitter.com/joshayala). I thought [your blog was dead](http://www.badempire.com/), but then I found the [tumble](http://josh.badempire.com/).
4.  [Jeff](http://twitter.com/jvh), you don't blog, afaik. You should tweet seven things and seven people!
5.  [Bowie](http://bowiesdive.blogspot.com/). Kid, you're almost one full year old. Introduce yourself.
6.  [James Earl Plush](http://www.litfuel.net/plush/). Eagles? Beagles? Twins? Coincidence? I think not!
7.  [David Cross](http://www.bobanddavid.com/david.html). (Aim high, right?)
* I've been [tumbling](http://dietrich.tumblr.com/) and [tweeting](http://twitter.com/dietrich) regularly, so I kinda already broke my resolution.
