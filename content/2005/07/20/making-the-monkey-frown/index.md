Looks like there is a serious exploit in [Greasemonkey](http://greaseblog.blogspot.com/). This [thread ](http://mozdev.org/pipermail/greasemonkey/2005-July/004022.html)provides the details. A ["neutered" version](http://greaseblog.blogspot.com/2005/07/mandatory-greasemonkey-update.html) has been provided, for use until the security hole is patched. Good luck Aaron!
