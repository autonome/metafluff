I installed [Skype](http://www.skype.com), a free  

voice-over-IP app. It recognized my PS2 USB headset (which seems to be  

a regular Logitech USB headset with a Playstation logo on it), and the  

Skype test call worked just fine.  

 So I bought 10 Euros of  

Skypeout credit. Skypeout is the service which allows you use Skype to  

call non-Skype numbers. I.E., regular phones. This also worked without  

a hitch. Well, almost: the sound quality is BAD. And the delay is BAD  

too. What a shame.  

 Has anyone else used Skype or Skypeout? Any tips on making it usable?
