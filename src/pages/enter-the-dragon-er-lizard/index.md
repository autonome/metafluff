A new year, a new blog, and a new job too: I hung up my star, and am no longer a Technical Yahoo!. Working at Yahoo! was an amazing experience; I met great people, got to work on interesting projects, and learned more in a year than is probably healthy. But then I got the call...

Last Monday was my first day as an employee of the [Mozilla Corporation](http://www.mozilla.com "Mozilla Corporation"). I'm working full-time on Firefox 2, on features such as [session restoration](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Session_Restore).

New Year's Resolution: blog more.
