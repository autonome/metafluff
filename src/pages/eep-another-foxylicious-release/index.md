Foxylicious 0.3 is now available. This release adds several new features:  

    -The ability to choose any location in your FF bookmarks tree to be the folder in which your del.icio.us bookmarks are placed. Setting up your del.icio.us folder in your Bookmarks Toolbar folder is especially cool.  

    - Foxylicious now *syncs* your remote bookmarks to the local store, thereby incorporating adds, updates and deletes.  

    - The context-menu for adding links to del.icio.us now works, thanks to Rob Harris, who contributed the code.  

One feature that did not make it in to 0.3 is exporting FF bookmarks to del.icio.us. I have it mostly implemented, but it either takes forever, or pounds the heck out of the server, due to limitations in the current API. Hopefully full bi-directionality will come in 0.4![Link](http://dietrich.ganx4.com/foxylicious)
