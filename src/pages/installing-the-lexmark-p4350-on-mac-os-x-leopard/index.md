1.  Uninstall the printer, if already installed from a previous version of OS X, or from previous attempts to install Lexmark's drivers
2.  Open Finder, click on your HD, find Library/Printers/Lexmark, and rename it to Lexmark.bak
3.  Reboot
4.  Insert your Leopard DVD, double-click Optional Installs, double-click Optional Installs.mpkg
5.  When Optional Installs has loaded, open Printer Drivers, and check the box next to Lexmark, then finish the installation process.
6.  Open System Preferences, and then Printer and Fax
7.  Click the + sign to add a new printer
8.  Your P4350 should show up as "4300 Series Printer" in the list. Select it.
9.  The dialog may spin for a few minutes. When done, it will enable the driver selection list. Select "4300 Series" from the list and click OK.
You should now be able to print. I did this on two different Macs, and it worked for both.
