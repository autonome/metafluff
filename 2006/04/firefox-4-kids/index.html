        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Today I gave a presentation to 120 4th graders, as a participant in Career Day at Lowell Elementary School in Long Beach, California. I covered some general intarweb topics, places I had worked, and then talked about Mozilla, Firefox and open-source software.</p>
<p>You can download my slides <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/Lowell_Career_Day.pdf">here</a>. Obviously, some topics were presented in a very simplified manner.</p>
<p>I did 3 presentations, to groups of 30-50 kids. I started the presentation by taking a survey (&quot;Raise your hand if...&quot;), then ran through my slides, and then took questions. Here are some observations from the day:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the kids had used a computer (they have a computer lab at the school).</li>
<li>Almost all of the kids said they had used the internet, and surfed the web.</li>
<li>About half of the kids said they used email.</li>
<li>About a quarter of the kids said that they used IM, and those kids were <em>really</em> excited about it.</li>
<li>Though almost every kid said they surfed the web, when I asked if they knew what a &quot;browser&quot; was, only a couple kids knew. However, I know that they actually <em>were</em> surfing the web because of the questions that they asked. It seemed that the browser was a piece of infrastructure that blended into their general computer experience.</li>
<li>They really didn&#39;t understand the difference between an internet connection and internet browser. When I said Firefox was free, some kids thought that meant they could get online for free.</li>
<li>Anywhere from 5-10 kids in each group had heard of Firefox.</li>
<li>1-2 kids in each group had heard of &quot;open-source&quot;.</li>
<li>The kids knew of viruses and phishing. They didn&#39;t understand what they were, but knew that they were bad, and from the internet.</li>
<li>The kids knew about MySpace, and were scared of predators. For real. In each group, someone brought up MySpace, and <em>always</em> in the context of a news story they saw on TV about how some creepy guy was trying to hook up with teenage girls. Local news must be pushing this story.</li>
<li>Computing in public education means Mac OS8 and Netscape Communicator. And we live in an <em>affluent</em> area. It was crazy to be talking to a group of kids who all knew about Netscape and <em>not</em> Firefox.</li>
<li>Games! The boys all played games via websites, and wanted to tell me all about them. The only game brought up by a girl was <a href="http://worldofwarcraft.com">WOW</a>.</li>
<li>They thought the Firefox logo was cool. They thought the Mozilla logo was cooler :)  Especially the boys. Several started grilling me on the anatomical incorrectness of the dinosaur: &quot;If it&#39;s from the pleocistene family it&#39;d have a bump on it&#39;s head and the nostrils would be in a different place.&quot; I had no response to that.</li>
<li>The kids all knew what &quot;non-profit&quot; meant, and each group had at least one of these kids: &quot;How does Mozilla make any money??!!&quot;. Long discussions about the economics of search referrals and advertising ensued.</li>
<li>The kids liked &quot;free&quot;, and they only grokked &quot;freedom&quot; when I asked a kid&#39;s name, and said he could take the source code and make his own &quot;JakobBrowser&quot; if he wanted. They loved that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, the kids seemed conversationally literate about the internet, more so than I was expecting. There was a general feeling that the internet was cool, but to be feared. They were definitely interested in Firefox, and asked where they could download it. They loved the Firefox stickers I gave out. Tons of thanks to <a href="http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/marcia/">Marcia</a>, who got me more stickers on short notice (I originally thought I was only presenting to my daughter&#39;s class).</p>
