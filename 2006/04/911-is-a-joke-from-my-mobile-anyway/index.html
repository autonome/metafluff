        <section class="post-content">
            <p>This morning a guy fell off his bike in front of our house. He had his dog on a leash, and it looked like the dog or leash had gotten tangled in the bike. He wasn&#39;t wearing a helmet. Blood ran from his head, almost down to the gutter, about 6 feet.</p>
<p>I grabbed my phone and ran out of the house when I heard a woman screaming for someone to call 911. After a glimpse at the scene out front,  I ran back in for a towel. While doing this, I called 911. I heard a voice answer, and I started to explain the situation. Almost immediately I noticed that the voice was still talking. It was a recording. I believe the recording said something about dialing more numbers to <em>really</em> get 911. But I&#39;m not sure. As soon as I realized it was a recording, I chucked the phone, while running back outside to try to keep this guy&#39;s brains where they belong.</p>
<p>WTF. I wonder if that recording I heard was from 911, or from my phone company, T-<a href="http://www.phone-movies.org">Mobile</a>. Either way, people could die because of crap like that.</p>
<p>A few other observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Head wounds bleed a lot of very thick blood.</li>
<li>Firefighters and EMTs walk very slowly, even in the presence of lots of very thick blood.</li>
<li>To clean up large amounts of blood, the EMTs use a special disinfectant that looks a bit like cat litter. They said to not hose the area down until it had sat for a few hours. However, a car drove by a few seconds later, leaving a trail of it down our street.</li>
<li>The dog shat itself because of the accident. Or it shat itself, causing the accident. Either way, it smelled really bad. (Can you tell I&#39;m not a dog person?)</li>
<li>My wife is paralyzed by the sight of blood. If this happens to me, and she&#39;s the only one around, I&#39;m S.O.L.</li>
<li>Note to self: Wear a friggin helmet.</li>
</ul>
