<h2 id="vr">VR</h2>
<p>With every passing day, virtual reality is becoming less weird and more a fact of life for developers and designers everywhere.</p>
<p>VR hardware isn&#39;t ubiquitous yet, and is actually still both cumbersome and expensive. Momentum is gathering regardless, both in experimentation and business investment.</p>
<p>The web is the largest deployment surface with the least friction for content of any kind. Given the still early stage that VR is at, being able to make it and publish it on the web provides the innovation vector that is required for VR to succeed.</p>
<h2 id="webvr">WebVR</h2>
<p>WebVR is a standard for exposing VR hardware capabilities to the software context of web applications, and then rendering the page to that hardware. The specification describes an API in JavaScript for enumerating HMDs and controllers, among other things.</p>
<p>Mozilla, Google and others have been working together over the last couple of years to develop the standard, and are now starting to ship the initial versions. The specification was tagged at version 1.1 but is not yet finalized, so implementations may yet change.</p>
<ul>
<li>WebVR spec development is driven by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webvr/">W3C WebVR Community Group</a></li>
<li><a href="https://w3c.github.io/webvr/">WebVR draft specification on W3C&#39;s Github</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API">WebVR API documentation on MDN</a></li>
<li>Most conversation happens on the <a href="https://webvr-slack.herokuapp.com/">WebVR Slack</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="simba.png"></p>
<h2 id="browser-support-for-webvr">Browser Support for WebVR</h2>
<ul>
<li>Firefox: Supported on Windows and Android since version 55 (beta at the time of this post), and in nightly builds on Mac.</li>
<li>Chrome: Supported, but off by default, need to flip a flag.</li>
<li>Edge: Supported unprefixed as of build 15002+ on Desktop, Mixed Reality, Mobile and Xbox.</li>
<li>Safari: Unsupported, but Apple just joined the WebVR community group, so there&#39;s a possibility of support but no explicit statement yet.</li>
<li>Samsung: Supported on Samsung Internet Browser for GearVR.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mobile-and-the-webvr-polyfill">Mobile and the WebVR Polyfill</h2>
<p>Smartphones can be used for WebVR experiences inside &quot;cardboard&quot; or other devices designed to contain a smartphone for HMD-like experiences.</p>
<p>These most often use the <a href="https://github.com/googlevr/webvr-polyfill">WebVR Polyfill</a>, a JavaScript library created by Google which mimics the WebVR API functionality, rendering the scene for each eye in software. Libraries like Three.js and A-Frame use the polyfill when no hardware is detected.</p>
<p>If you open an A-Frame scene on your mobile phone and touch the HMD icon, the polyfill will kick in and you&#39;ll see the scene rendered for each eye separately, and you can then insert the phone inside a VR viewing device.</p>
<p>The polyfill uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Detecting_device_orientation">orientation web API</a>, so even responds to your movement, allowing you to look all around within the scene.</p>
<p><img src="cardboard.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="hmd-support">HMD Support</h2>
<p>Currently both retail versions of the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift work with Firefox and Chrome&#39;s implementations of WebVR. Instructions for all of these combinations are at <a href="https://mozvr.com/#start">Mozvr.com</a>.</p>
<p>Microsoft Edge only supports their Mixed Reality hardware at this time.</p>
<p>David Rousset <a href="https://www.davrous.com/2017/07/07/from-zero-to-hero-creating-webvr-experiences-with-babylon-js-on-all-platforms/">wrote a great overview</a> of writing a WebVR application that works in all hardware platforms, with this excellent visualization of browsers and hardware platforms. One thing to add is Firefox Android also supports WebVR from version 55.</p>

<h2 id="augmented-city">Augmented City</h2>
<p>The Augmented City event is an all-day workshop focused on quickly prototyping AR/VR experiences on the web, and with a theme of Singapore itself.</p>
<p>What does an augmented Singapore look like? What can it do? What can you do in it? Maybe it tells its own story - its history. Maybe it shows you what music is happening nearby, or which hawker stalls you should try. Maybe lets you see <a href="http://nationalmuseum.sg/exhibitions/exhibition-list/singapore-very-old-tree">trees that used to be</a>, or shows visualizations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Singapore#/media/File:KITLV_-_150813_-_Lambert_%26_Co.,_G.R._-_Singapore_-_Port_at_Singapore_-_circa_1890.tif">changing waterline</a> over time as the city grew.</p>
<p>Some more ideas: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>I love <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BVl2DJgAwgJ/">these visuals from @rockintosh on Instagam</a> - the ArtScience Museum disintegrating and floating away is fantastic. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Use public data to create 3D and virtual maps with tools like <a href="https://github.com/UDST/vizicities">Vizicities</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Vive put up a post with a bunch of <a href="https://blog.vive.com/us/2017/05/12/experience-history-in-vr/">examples of teaching history through VR</a>, and the BBC made <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/taster/projects/romes-invisible-city-vr">this exploration of the Pantheon in Rome</a>. I&#39;ve been playing with a model of Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong (but it&#39;s not ready yet...). What in Singapore&#39;s history can you recreate virtually?</p>
</li>
<li><p>These <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BV9TapglsAq/">&quot;following eyes&quot; from NYPSIDM students</a> here in Singapore are fantastic. Imagiine an AR version, placed all around the city!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Tell a story about the musical history of Singapore, or showcase contemporary music using AR. I like this use of AR for <a href="https://goldcomputing.show/2017/05/30/vinylart/">scanning record covers to listen and learn more about the music they contain</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>To be honest, I want an AR app that translates the kopitiam menus into something I can understand so I can order coffee the right way... somehow I always order it wrong!</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I started trying to write down why, but quit. It&#39;s not very useful. I&#39;m an outlier, and that&#39;s fine.</p>
<p>If you are thinking to yourself &quot;that&#39;s stupid, why would anyone do that!&quot;, you should probably stop reading. Find something nice to read that validates your assumptions about how all people should be, and enjoy your morning coffee.</p>
<p>All users are different, and each &quot;misuse&quot; of a software program is the reverberating echo of people trying to get things done. This is a story about using software how <em>I</em> think it <em>should</em> work.</p>
<p>In this case the software is Firefox, and it handled my behavio(u)r quite poorly for a long time. I got used to multi-minute startup time, waiting 15-30 seconds for tabs from external apps to show up, and all kinds of non-responsive behavio(u)r.</p>
<p>And then everything changed.</p>
<h2 id="quantum-flow">Quantum Flow</h2>
<p>Right now, more effort is being put into making Firefox fast than I&#39;ve seen since... well, since I&#39;ve been working on Firefox. And I&#39;ve been at Mozilla for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Part of this effort is a project called Quantum Flow - a bunch of engineers making changes that directly impact Firefox responsiveness.
To learn more and follow along, check out the <a href="">collection of bugs</a>, and also read <a href="https://ehsanakhgari.org/tag/quantumflow">Ehsan Akhgari&#39;s weekly newsletter posts</a>.</p>
<p>A lot of the improvement in this particular scenario is from Kevin Jones&#39; work on bringing the overall cost of unloaded tabs as close to zero as possible.
While the major work has landed, the work continues in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=906076">Bug 906076</a>.
Huge amounts of thanks for the recent wins for us pathological tab hoarders go to Kevin, Dão Gottwald, Mike de Boer, Tim Taubert, David Teller, Mike Conley, and Gijs Kruitbosch.</p>
<h2 id="test-scenario">Test Scenario</h2>
<p>I took my 1691 tab browser profile, and did a wall-clock measurement of start-up time and memory use for Firefox versions 20, 30, 40, and 50 through 56.</p>
<p>These are my personal results. You might not get the same results. If you test 1691 (or even 1692) tabs and find something totally different, I&#39;d love to hear about it.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I shut down most things on my Macbook (yeah the little one that&#39;s more like a glorified iPad).</p>
</li>
<li><p>I turned off wifi. This is a measurement of <em>Firefox</em>, not the network.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I measured by eyeball, using &quot;time cat&quot; on the command line. I&#39;m totally ok with how coarse the numbers are. I&#39;m measuring <em>minutes</em>, so microsecond precision is not required.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I measured startup time five times, dropping highs and lows. Even that wasn&#39;t really necessary - the times were <em>startingly consistent</em>. With almost 1700 tabs and &gt;5 minute startup, the standard deviation was negligible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For startup, I measured up until the &quot;server not found&quot; page showed up in the active tab. After lots of testing, I found this to be the point at which the application became responsive and usable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For memory, I waited until one minute after the startup measurement point and then grabbed the total value from the bottom of about:memory. I waited one minute, because I observed a consistent spike in memory after startup which went away within the first minute and then stabilized for a long period after. It&#39;s all kinds of initialization that doesn&#39;t need to block the app from starting, but needs to happen once you get to browsing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I tested Firefox versions 20, 30, 40, and 50 through 56. I tried testing Firefox 10 but it permahung while loading the profile.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="start-up-time">Start-up Time</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s a graph of startup time across Firefox versions:</p>
<p><img src="startup.png" style="height: 15rem;"></p>
<p>Interesting to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>We consistently got <em>worse</em> over time until Firefox 51. It&#39;d be interesting to do this test with varying numbers of tabs and find out at what point the regressions become noticeable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="memory-usage">Memory Usage</h2>
<p><img src="memory.png" style="height: 15rem;"></p>
<h2 id="why-this-is-important">Why This is Important</h2>
<p>Browser vendors use telemetry, user research and a number of other ways of determining &quot;acceptable use&quot; of their products. Anything outside of that idea of acceptable use is generally unsupported.</p>
<p>For example, Mozilla found some years ago that the ceiling of the number of tabs for most users of Firefox was 15. Most people had far fewer tabs than that. While I interpret that as a failure of tabs as a functional metaphor for managing web pages in a single application, it&#39;s generally been used a functionality scope for what the browser should support and be performant for.</p>
<ul>
<li>power user long tail</li>
<li>tab groups, alternate models</li>

The difference is amazing - the conference has grown to be one of the largest open source events in Asia, with more than <a href="http://2017.fossasia.org/speakers.html">200 speakers</a> over three days across 13 tracks and now hosted in Singapore.</p>

<p>The conference is entirely open source and volunteer-run, which is really neat. Kudos to the organizers for putting it on, which is a huge amount of work. The focus on free and open source software and tracks on relevant topics like AI, Bitcoin, and IoT combine to make a great collection of people to put in one place for a weekend.</p>

<p>Mozilla didn&#39;t directly sponsor this year, but instead sent some of our Tech Speakers who had talks accepted and myself. We were seven people from six countries, speaking about VR, WebAssembly, Web-RTC, security, IoT, AR and more. Big thanks to Bob Reyes, Diky Arga Anggara, Noritada Shimizu, Santosh Viswanatham, Shah Mijanur Rahman and Trishul Goel for speaking at the conference and putting in a bunch of hours at our table every day.</p>

<p>The number of speakers was enough of a presence to earn us a table in the exhibition hall, so we took advantage of the opportunity and demo&#39;d A-Frame VR and AR on mobile devices for all three days.</p>
<p>The response was <em>fantastic</em> - lots of people having their first VR experience of any kind, and everyone was mindblown that the demos were built using web technologies, running in a browser, and on a mobile phone.</p>

<p>After three days of rapping with everyone who came by the booth, here are a few impressions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most people, developers included, haven&#39;t strongly engaged in VR yet. If you assume everyone is doing it, you&#39;re probably in the VR industry and you&#39;re wrong. I&#39;ve been demoing VR at conferences for the last couple of years and I always ask if people have tried it before and the answer is usually &quot;no&quot;. VR may be in the limelight in tech news, but the on-the-ground experience says it&#39;s still very early days.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A-Frame has excellent name recognition. This conversation a lot: &quot;This was made with a JavaScript library called A-Frame.&quot; &quot;Oh, A-Frame!&quot; &quot;You&#39;ve used it?&quot; &quot;No, but I&#39;ve heard of it and it looks awesome!&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Almost nobody was talking about bots.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Almost everybody was talking about AI and machine learning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People are <em>still</em> asking us about Firefox OS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conference">Conference</h2>
<p>What I liked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great crowd. It really feels like a practitioners conference where people are learning reciprocally.</li>
<li>Talk topics are really good. Very little fluff on the schedule. Great mix of interesting and practical topics. Good job by organizers here.</li>
<li>Excellent conference website and apps. They&#39;re writing their own FOSS event management stack, and it seems pretty great so far.</li>
<li>Communication from organizers prior to the event was really good. Combination of emails for important things, and Google Group and Slack for general communication really worked well.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&#39;d like to see next year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers should not have to pay for tickets.</li>
<li>Need a venue that&#39;s centrally located, easier to navigate and that lets attendees focus on the conference.</li>
<li>Singapore already has lots of events, and is famously expensive for hotel and venue space. To make a truly pan-Asian conference, should move around to different cities.</li>
<li>The schedule was changed at the last minute without warning to speakers, causing some to miss their talks. Need to lock the schedule down, and communicate changes very clearly.</li>
<li>Day two and three each have <em>15</em> tracks! I&#39;d prefer to see a smaller and more focused set of tracks.</li>

What is Mozfest? <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">From the website:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>MozFest is an annual celebration of the open Internet movement. It&#39;s where passionate technologists, educators, and makers come together to explore the future of the open Web.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds pretty cool... but what does an &quot;annual celebration&quot; of web exploration actually look like? Well, here&#39;s something a bit more of a visual:</p>
<p>Imagine an nine-floor open-plan art school in London, completely taken over for a weekend by over 400 artists, designers, activists, teachers, hackers and makers, putting on hundreds of workshops, talks and building and showing interactive art, games and various other exhibits of thrilling wonder.</p>
<p>It&#39;s truly spectacular and an overwhelming thing to experience.</p>
<p>My biggest wish for Mozfest is for it to leave London - to transform into a regional distributed series of festivals that bring these wonders to the world outside of London (I hear it exists!). Hopefully that will happen someday.</p>
<p>But for now, read on to learn about some of the spaces, projects and exhibits I participated in this year.</p>
<h2 id="-dilemmas-in-connected-spaces-"><strong>Dilemmas in Connected Spaces</strong></h2>
<p><img src="dwygzeg.png" alt="dwygzeg"></p>
<p>Mozfest is composed of a number of &quot;spaces&quot;, most of which are housed on specific floors: Journalism, Science, Arts, Youth, etc. This year I was one of the curators and coordinators of the Dilemmas in Connected Spaces... space.</p>
<p>There are a zillion websites, tutorials, workshops and classes that provide how-to knowledge of IoT, so we decided to not use our space to duplicate those efforts.</p>
<p>Instead, we designed our space to explore the challenges that arise from the ubiquity of connected physical computing devices in our lives. and then built it with 500 cardboard boxes!</p>
<p> <img src="cf3sf0r.png" alt="cf3sf0r"></p>
<p>We divided the space into different zones: The Open IoT Studio, Home, Garden and the Nomad Tent Camp. I decided to explore the dilemma of over-stimulation in our digital lives by running the Nomad Tent Camp, a chill zone where almost nothing was scheduled - a place for weary Mozfest travelers to rest their weary feat, chill out and talk with other explorers. I set up a couple of large spray shelters as tents, and filled the area with comfy chairs. Sure enough, all weekend long we had people coming through and doing naught be relaxing and chatting with strangers they met at this quiet oasis amongst the chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Somehow I have no pictures of my own zone! Please use this placeholder to imagine it.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;d like to learn about the rest of the Dilemmas in Connected Spaces activities, you can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/ileddigital">Jon Rogers</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/thornet">Michelle Thorne</a>&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/openiotstudio">Open IoT Studio</a>, read about <a href="https://twitter.com/cubicgarden">Ian Forrester</a>&#39;s <a href="http://cubicgarden.com/2016/10/23/this-time-next-week-ill-be-at-mozfest-2016/">Home space</a> and hear what <a href="https://twitter.com/msaunby">Michael Saunby</a> did in the Garden on this <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/making-conversations-1-november-2016/">radio interview</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-mozfestation-get-infected-with-ideas-"><strong>Mozfestation.... GET INFECTED... WITH IDEAS!</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kc_coffeekid">Katie Caldwell</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ezoehunt">Liz Hunt</a> and I worked on a project that came out of their work in the Connected Devices group on <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-magnet/magnet">Project Magnet</a> and some of my Bluetooth experiments called Mozfestation. We wanted a way to encourage people to explore more of the festival than they would&#39;ve otherwise - and to get exposed to as many ideas as possible during the weekend. And I had a 100 beacons...</p>
<p><img src="egfpmlb.png" alt="egfpmlb"></p>
<p>So we made iOS and Android apps for discovering, accessing and saving beacons (a hacked version of Magnet&#39;s React Native app, made web pages for 100 curated things at Mozfest, made a leaderboard for showing top-visited beacons and the users who&#39;d seen the most beacons, and then put posters and flyers all over the festival to let people know about it.</p>
<p><img src="hkhbgrk.png" alt="hkhbgrk"></p>
<p>In the end, it was a ton of work and a ton of fun. We learned a ton about large-scale beacon deployments, minimum-viable-gamification, mobile app uptake tactics and loads more. It was a huge experiment and it was FASCINATING. There&#39;s a lot involved in the design, implementation, festival execution, and the analysis of the data collected, so I&#39;ll go over all of that in a separate post.</p>
<h2 id="-a-painter-3d-painting-in-virtual-reality-">**A-Painter: 3D Painting in Virtual Reality!</h2>
<p>**</p>
<p><img src="apainter_painting.gif" alt="apainter_painting"></p>
<p>One addition to the space was <a href="https://blog.mozvr.com/a-painter/">Mozilla&#39;s A-Painter</a>, a purely web-based virtual reality 3D painting experience. It&#39;s a web app written using <a href="http://aframe.io/">A-Frame</a>, the web toolkit for building 3D and VR experiences in the browser. A-Frame is both incredibly powerful and incredibly easy to use, and it was showing up all over the festival, almost anywhere that someone was doing a session or exhibit about VR.</p>
<p>We set up the A-Painter space next to the nomad tent camp, which is on the 6th floor of the school, where the fashion classes are taught. The whole space is littered with mannequins that have paper-prototypes of clothing concepts on them. We clustered a bunch of these around the space and even used two of them to hold the HTC Vive&#39;s positional sensors.</p>

<h2 id="-vanity-trumps-privacy-trumps-vanity-"><strong>Vanity Trumps Privacy Trumps Vanity</strong></h2>
<p>Since the demise of Firefox OS, I&#39;ve been collecting all of the old Flame developer devices that I can get my hands on. These are smartphones, no... <em>computers</em>, packed with sensors, and with screens built-in, and with the ability to run applications built using the web stack but with access to WAY more functionality than traditional web pages. I&#39;ve been using them as IoT devices, art pieces, privacy tools and more. I&#39;ve been playing around with using them as camera arrays, and have a few side-projects (as yet unfinished) doing things like turning them into piecemeal mega-screens, chandeliers, etc.</p>
<p>So when Kevin Fann started talking about his idea for an exhibit at Mozfest that explored the tension between vanity and privacy, all I could think about was how the selfie is a fantastic expression of that tension, and I&#39;ve got all these smartphones... no, <em>cameras</em> lying around.</p>
<p>Kevin, Jordan Gushwa and I designed a walk-through experience with loads of phones on selfie-mode and even a secret hidden camera that records live video and displays out <em>outside</em> the exhibit... so you don&#39;t know you&#39;re being recorded until <em>after</em> you exit.</p>
<p>Kevin created eye-catching frames and placements for all the phones, and selected a few relevant video clips to have repeating on some of the phones. I wrote some code that streamed the live video from the hidden phone over Web-RTC to a Raspberry Pi hooked up to a screen outside the exhibit.</p>
<p>Kevin packed everything up into suitcase, which could not have looked more bomb-like:</p>
<p><img src="2foz1de.png" alt="2foz1de"></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a video tour of the wall in all its glory:</p>

<p>The end-result was epic: People were <em>mesmerized</em> by so many phones showing them the live camera view of themselves.</p>
<p><img src="kt2nlyt.png" alt="kt2nlyt"></p>
<p>Mozfest 2016. It&#39;s over. I&#39;m exhausted. It was a parade of wonders. I hope someday it will come your way.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

I am excited about this experiment because we&#39;ve had some <a href="http://topics.oregonlive.com/tag/toxic%20air/">serious air quality discoveries in Portland</a> recently - our air is possibly <a href="http://koin.com/2016/03/02/study-portland-air-among-worst-in-nation/">the worst in the USA</a>, and bad enough that <a href="http://koin.com/2016/02/26/erin-brockovich-joins-portland-air-quality-fight/">mega-activists like Erin Brockovich are getting involved</a>.</p>
<p><img src="screen-shot-2016-07-13-at-5-21-01-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-13 at 5.21.01 PM"></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, Eddie and Evan from Project SensorWeb helped me put together a NodeMCU board and a PM2.5 sensor so I could set up an air quality sensor in Portland to report to their network. They&#39;re still setting up the project so I haven&#39;t gotten the configuration info from them yet...</p>
<p>But you don&#39;t need the SensorWeb server to get your sensor up and running and pushing data to your own server! I want a copy of the data for myself anyway, to be able to do my own visualizations and notifications. I can then forward the data on to SensorWeb.</p>
<p>So I started by flashing the current version of the SensorWeb code to the device, which is a Nodemcu 0.9 board with an ESP8266 wifi chip on board, and a PM2.5 sensor attached to it.</p>
<p><img src="2016-07-13-17-05-59.jpg" alt="2016-07-13 17.05.59"></p>
<p>I used <a href="https://rishav006.wordpress.com/2016/06/22/pm2-5-a-sensorweb-project-by-mozilla/">Kumar Rishav&#39;s excellent step-by-step post</a> to get through the process.</p>
<p>Some things I learned along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>On Mac OS X you need a <a href="https://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx">serial port driver</a> in order for the Arduino IDE to detect the board.</li>
<li>After much gnashing of teeth, I discovered that you can&#39;t have the PM2.5 sensor plugged into the board when you flash it.
After getting the regular version flashed correctly, I tested with Kumar&#39;s API key and device id, and confirmed it was reporting the data correctly to the SensorWeb server.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for the changes.</p>
<ul>
<li>I set up <a href="https://ifttt.com/maker">the Maker channel on IFTTT</a>, which allows me post data to an HTTP endpoint to get it into IFTTT&#39;s system.</li>
<li>I then created a new <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/440904-save-pm2-5-data-to-a-spreadsheet">IFTTT recipe that accepts the data from the device and pushes it into a Google spreadsheet</a>.</li>
<li>I forked the SensorWeb code and <a href="https://github.com/autonome/arduino-station/blob/master/station/nodemcu/nodemcu.ino">modified it to post to the Maker channel instead of the SensorWeb server</a>.
I flashed the device and viola, it is publishing data to my spreadsheet.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="screen-shot-2016-07-13-at-4-48-28-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-13 at 4.48.28 PM"></p>
<p>And now once SensorWeb is ready to take new devices, I can set up a new IFTTT recipe to forward the posts to them, allowing me to own my own data and also publish to the project!</p>

<p>Last month I spent a week working on IoT projects with a group of 40 researchers, designers and coders... in Anstruther, a small fishing village in Scotland. Not a high-tech hub, but that was the point. We immersed ourselves in a small community with limited connectivity and interesting weather (and <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g551743-d1898308-Reviews-The_Wee_Chippy-Anstruther_Fife_Scotland.html">fantastic F&amp;C</a>) in order to explore how they use technology and how ubiquitous physical computing might be woven into their lives.</p>
<p>The ideamonsters behind this event were <a href="https://twitter.com/thornet">Michelle Thorne</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ileddigital">Jon Rogers</a>, who are putting on a series of these exploratory events around the world this year as part of the Mozilla Foundation&#39;s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Open_IoT">Open IoT Studio</a>. The two previous editions of this event were a train caravan in India and a fablab sprint in Berlin (which I also attended, and will write up as well. I SWEAR.).</p>
<p>Michelle and Jon will be writing a proper summary of the week as a whole, so I&#39;m going to focus on the project my group built: Bubble.</p>
<p><img src="screen-shot-2016-07-12-at-3-18-39-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-12 at 3.18.39 PM"></p>
<h2 id="-context-"><strong>Context</strong></h2>
<p>From research conducted with local fishing folk, farmers from a bit inland, and a group of teenagers from the local school, we figured out a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile connectivity is sparse and unreliable</strong> throughout the whole region. In this particular town, only about half the town had any service.</li>
<li>The important <strong>information, places and things aren&#39;t immediately obvious</strong> unless you know a local.</li>
<li>Just like I was, growing up in a small town: <strong>The kids are just looking for something to do.</strong>
Initially we focused on the teens... fun things like virtual secret messaging at the red telephone boxes. Imagine you connect to the wifi at the phone box, and the captive portal is a web UI for leaving and receiving secret messages. Perhaps they&#39;re only read once before dying, like a hyperlocal Snapchat. Perhaps the system is user-less, mediated only by secret combinations of emojis as keys. The street corner becomes the hangout, physically and digitally.</li>
</ul>
<p>We meandered to public messaging from there, thinking about how there&#39;s so much to learn and share about the physical space. What&#39;s the story behind the messages to fairies that are being left in that phone box? I can see the island off the coast from here - what&#39;s it called and what&#39;s out there? Who the hell is Urquardt and what&#39;s a &quot;wynd&quot;? Maybe we make a public message board as well - disconnected from the internet but connected to anything within view.</p>
<p>We kept going back to the physical space. We talked about a virtual graffiti wall, and then started exploring AR and ways of marking up the surroundings - the people, the history, the local pro-tip on which fish and chips shop is the best. But all of this available only to people in close physical proximity.</p>
<p><img src="screen-shot-2016-07-12-at-3-40-49-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-12 at 3.40.49 PM"></p>
<h2 id="-implementation-"><strong>Implementation</strong></h2>
<p>Given the context and the constraints, as well as watching direction some of the other groups were going in, we started designing a general approach to bringing digital interactivity to disconnected spaces.</p>
<p>The first cut is <strong>Bubble</strong>: A <strong>wi-fi access point</strong> with a <strong>captive portal</strong> that opens a web page that displays an <strong>augmented reality</strong> view of your <strong>immediate surroundings</strong>, with messages overlaid on what you&#39;re seeing:</p>
<p><img src="screen-shot-2016-07-12-at-2-36-26-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-12 at 2.36.26 PM"></p>
<p>A few implementation notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>We used a Raspberry Pi 3, running as a wi-fi access point.</li>
<li>It ran a node.js script that served up the captive portal web UI.</li>
<li>The web UI used getUserMedia to access the device camera awe.js for the AR bits and A-Frame for a VR backup view on iOS.</li>
<li>We designed a logo and descriptive text and then lasercut some plaques to put up where hotspots are.
<strong>Designs, board, battery and boxes:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="screen-shot-2016-07-12-at-3-58-10-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-07-12 at 3.58.10 PM">
<strong>Connected to the front-end:</strong></p>

<p><strong>In the final box:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Captive portals are hobbled web pages. You can&#39;t do things like use getUserMedia to get access to the camera.</li>
<li>iOS doesn&#39;t have <em>any</em> way to let web pages access the camera.</li>
<li>Power can be hard. We talked about solar and other ways of powering these.</li>
<li>Gotta hope they don&#39;t get nicked.
Bubble was an experimental prototype. There are no plans to work further on it at this time. If you&#39;re interested, everything is on Github <a href="https://github.com/autonome/bubble">here</a>. You can read more about the design <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/yj11w3g3scwu93q/Bubble_DesignSprint_Scotland.pdf?dl=0">here (PDF)</a>.</li>

Having to repeatedly wait and hit the wrench button has always bothered me. During a development session I may do this hundreds of times.</p>
<p>So I wrote a small Firefox add-on that changes the functionality of the &quot;play&quot; button in Web IDE to also open the Developer Tools once the app has launched.</p>
<p>Warning: It&#39;s not pretty. There&#39;s probably a better way to do it. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/autonome/webide-autodebug">the source here</a> and let me know if you have ideas.</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webide-auto-debug/">INSTALL</a></p>
<p>A couple of other things I want to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>First force-stop app when you hit Play. Currently the new app source doesn&#39;t get reloaded because the old app instance is running, which is wrong and maddening.</li>
<li>Always show dev tools. The way the pop in and out is very heavy feeling. Just keep them open all the time.</li>
</ul>

<p>But two things were driving me batty about the Pocket feature built into Firefox:</p>
<ol>
<li>The design of the popup experience when you save a page to Pocket is... unfortunate. It stays up far too long, <strong>and</strong> it doesn&#39;t go away when you switch tabs. Yeah, it stays open for a given URL even when you&#39;re on a tab with a completely different URL! But regardless of whether you think that&#39;s as crazy as I do, I never want to add tags so just don&#39;t need it at all.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="screen-shot-2016-02-19-at-11-17-56-am.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-19 at 11.17.56 AM"></p>
<ol>
<li>The Pocket toolbar button doesn&#39;t indicate whether you&#39;ve already saved the page or not. You have to click the button to figure it out. Now this might not be a problem for everyone. But the way I use my browser can best be described as &quot;tabsplosion&quot;. I don&#39;t know when or where these tabs come from, or how they get there, or whether I saved it already or not. So this tiny piece of ambient visual signal would be useful for me.</li>
</ol>
<p>So I took a couple of hours over the last few evenings and scratched the itch. I made a Firefox add-on which does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Adds a new Pocket button to the toolbar. (You can remove the old one by right-clicking it and choosing &quot;Remove from Toolbar&quot;). Mine is red. I want to make one that has nice gold double-stitching on it...</p>
</li>
<li><p>The new button shows a check mark badge when the page is already saved.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can click the button to either add or remove the page from Pocket.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No popup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#39;s it. Simple, clear and out of your way.</p>

WELCOME!</p>
<p>Here is a list of things I recommend that you see, do, eat and drink and some handy tips. I&#39;ve focused on places that are in or near downtown, though included some spots worth going out of your way for.</p>
<p>That said, downtown is not Portland. Well, obviously it&#39;s part of it, duh. But it&#39;s not overly representative of the Portland you&#39;ve heard so much about. Get out of downtown for an evening or afternoon - and check out one of the neighborhoods. Nothing listed here is very far from downtown - Portland is pretty small.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve left a LOT out. And forgot the rest. If you have recommendations, leave them in the comments.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Blue Star donuts, which are far more delicious but far less penis-shaped than Voodoo donuts, will be <a href="http://pdx.eater.com/2014/11/26/7295121/blue-star-donuts-anniversary-free-beignets-expanded-menu">giving away free beignets on Friday Dec 5</a>.</p>
<p>GENERAL TIPS</p>
<ul>
<li>Portland has no Uber or Uber-like services. If you have Car2Go in your city you can use that here too. <a href="http://gocurb.com/">Curb </a>is the app for local taxi service through a couple of providers. You can get a bus to pretty much anywhere without too much of a wait. Ride the MAX and streetcar if you&#39;re headed to areas that they service.</li>
<li>Oregon has no sales tax. Do your Christmas shopping while you&#39;re here.</li>
<li>It gets dark around 16:30 - 17:00, so factor that into any plans for hikes, etc.</li>
<li>If you go into the mountains, check the road conditions to see if you need chains for the car, or if the area is accessible at all.</li>
<li>Go to Powell&#39;s books. Go a few times. Then go back again. Check out the Science Fiction pillar there - how many have you read?</li>
<li>Get high... for a good view of the city: Have a drink at Departures, dinner at Portland City Grill or visit Pittock Mansion for great views of the city. Even driving over the Fremont bridge (Highway 405) provides a spectacular view of downtown, the Willamette River and our many bridges.</li>
<li>There aren&#39;t a ton of restaurants/bars/coffeehouses that can hold large numbers of people. If you break up into groups of four (max), you&#39;ll have a much better time and the servers, chefs, baristas and bartenders will like you for it.</li>
<li>Be patient. Oregon is home to the slow-food movement in America. Regardless if this explains why your coffee took 20 f<em>*</em>ing minutes to make, it&#39;ll make you feel better to think about that. See also the above note about small group sizes to mitigate the waits.</li>
<li><p>Tipping: I tip a dollar for a good coffee. I generally tip ~20% for any kind of sit-down meal. But I also worked as a barista, server and chef before getting into tech, so I&#39;m biased towards tipping ;)
CARTS - Just the 9th &amp; Alder pod for the purposes of this post. If you&#39;re from California - up here they are not &quot;food trucks&quot;, they are &quot;food carts&quot;... even when they are trucks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hoang&#39;s - Get soup #17.</p>
</li>
<li>Nong&#39;s khao man gai - Simple and good and oddly famous.</li>
<li>Wolf &amp; Bear - Israeli street food that is amazing. And vegan.</li>
<li>Güero - Excellent tortas. Add an egg.</li>
<li>La Jarochita 2 - Great Mexican cart. The only Mexican cart (aside from Güero) worth going to at the 9th and Alder cart pod.</li>
<li>Brunch Box - A cart that graduated to a proper storefront, but is right by the 9th and Alder carts. Great egg sandwiches for breakfast (try the Black and Blue) and terribly good burgers the rest of time. Very fast.</li>
<li><p>Kargi Gogo - Georgian food. The country, not the American state. Irakli says it&#39;s legit too.
DRINK</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multnomah Whiskey Library</p>
</li>
<li>Clyde Common</li>
<li>Pepe le Moko</li>
<li>Teardrop</li>
<li><p>Bailey&#39;s Taproom
COFFEE</p>
</li>
<li><p>Courier - They also make fresh canneles daily.</p>
</li>
<li>Heart - Excellent coffee.</li>
<li>Barista</li>
<li>Coffeehouse Northwest</li>
<li>Stumptown</li>
<li>Case Study</li>
<li>Coava - Not downtown but my favorite coffee roaster in town.</li>
<li><p>Ristretto - Not downtown, but fantastic coffee in beautiful spaces. The Nicolai location is especially great - check out the custom metalwork and crazy woodwork, and visit Schoolhouse Electric in the same space.
EAT - I&#39;ve only noted a few of my go-to places, or those that are near where Mozillians are staying, or open late, etc. I&#39;ve got a <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/054ed2b6-227a-4934-aaf5-afaeff3f09e6/8b18f677e359bdd1823ec784dc22bfb1">somewhat-up-to-date list here</a> with more recommendations, but there&#39;s just really too much to cover. Go out and explore.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clyde Common - Always interesting menu, good whiskey selection, great cocktails. Fries + harissa and a cocktail is a great way to end your day and start your evening.</p>
</li>
<li>Tasty and Alder (downtown) - Shared plates, everything is good.</li>
<li>Luc Lac - Vietnamese + cocktails, serves food VERY late, and closest place worth going to that&#39;s also near the Waterfront Marriot.</li>
<li>Bunk - Excellent sandwiches.</li>
<li>Lardo - Excellent sandwiches as well.</li>
<li>Racion - Amazing cocktails and fun Spanish-tinged molecular gastronomy.</li>
<li>Little Big Burger - Fast and good late night burger.</li>
<li><p>Not downtown, but places I always want to go back to...</p>
<ul>
<li>Biwa - Izakaya, open late, always amazing. Burger served only after 11pm.</li>
<li>Tarad - Northern Thai food, open late. Pok Pok gets all the attention but after living in northern Thailand, this is where we go for the real thing.</li>
<li>Mee Sen - Another good Northern Thai food spot we go to.</li>
<li>Podnah&#39;s BBQ - Worth heading up into NE Portland for.</li>
<li>La Taq - Next door to Podnah&#39;s, fantastic Mexican bar food.</li>
<li>Sweedeedee - Most likely to feel like you&#39;re in Portlandia at this spot. Amazing house-baked breads. Tiny. Expect a long wait but good people watching and excellent food.</li>
<li>Por Que No (Mississippi location) - Great tacos.</li>
<li>Ha &amp; VL - Get the special soup of the day, whatever it is.
NEIGHBORHOODS - Places to walk, eat, drink, shop and experience parts of Portland that are far more interesting than downtown.</li>

EXCURSIONS</p>
</li>
<li><p>Columbia Gorge - See Multnomah Falls, the view from Vista House, climb Beacon Rock, stop at the Bonneville Dam and see Herman the Sturgeon, drive across the Bridge of the Gods (and back), then go for lunch at one of the Hood River breweries. Some easy/moderate 1-2 hour hikes I like: Angel&#39;s Rest, the Multnomah/Wahkeena Falls loop, Triple Falls,  Horsetail Falls, Punchbowl Falls, <a href="http://www.portlandhikersfieldguide.org/wiki/Columbia_River_Gorge_Hikes">all listed here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>Mount Hood - Drive out Highway 26 to the historic Timberline Lodge with amazing views of Mt Hood (if it&#39;s clear), then down to Hood River and head home through the Columbia Gorge on Hwy 84.</li>
<li>Mount St Helens - A couple of hours north, but the view of the blast zone and crater from the visitor center on the NW side is well worth it if the view is clear. On the SE side you can hike one mile underground through Ape Cave, and check out the amazing rock formations and brave the cable bridge at Lava Canyon.</li>
<li>Oregon Coast - About two hours drive. Walk the promenade at Seaside, get ice cream at Tillamook, watch storms from the tip of Oregon at the mouth of the Columbia river.</li>

However, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=983758">we haven&#39;t been able to control spam on those lists</a>. Not only does spam not get caught before hitting Mailman, the built-in spam rules don&#39;t work - I configured the rules to discard anything above spam level 1, and tons of spam is still held for moderation. But identification <em>does</em> work... so we can just ignore the moderation queue forever and move on with life, right? No. Because we have another problem: The newsgroups support means that valid posts might be held for processing because Mailman doesn&#39;t know the sender is valid because they subscribed through Google Groups. So we have to view the lists and mark those messages as valid and add the sender to the valid-senders list. To cap it all off, in the long tradition of open source user interface design, Mailman has a full featured but RSI-inducing UI for managing all of this.</p>
<p>So if you&#39;re an admin for a bunch of Mailman lists, here&#39;s a mitigation that might make your day suck just a little bit less:</p>
<p>I wrote a bookmarklet that will do the following for all messages held for moderation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the radio button to discard the message</li>
<li>Check the box to auto-discard from that sender</li>
<li>Check the box to ban the sender from ever subscribing again
<del><strong>To install, drag this link to your bookmarks Toolbar: <a>Mailman - discard and ban all</a></strong></del></li>
</ul>
<p>Wordpress removes JavaScript in links, so create a new bookmark and copy the following code into the URL field:</p>
<p><code>javascript:function%20qsa(e){return[].slice.call(document.querySelectorAll(e))}qsa(%22input[type=RADIO][name^=senderaction]%22).forEach(function(e){e.checked=!0}),qsa(%22input[type=CHECKBOX][name^=senderfilter]%22).forEach(function(e){e.checked=!0}),qsa(%22input[type=CHECKBOX][name^=senderbanp]%22).forEach(function(e){e.checked=!0});</code></p>
<p>Remember to make VERY sure that none of the messages are valid before executing this bookmarklet... not only because valid messages will be discarded and their senders will be banned, but also because the UI for removing addresses from the block-list in Mailman is even worse than the one for moderation.</p>

Likes. Check-ins. Steps. Photos. Links. We emit a constant stream of content into the sites we use everyday. Is it ours? Well, it feels like it. And according to the terms of service, it kind of belongs to us. Sometimes. Maybe. I don&#39;t know, honestly. I don&#39;t read those, and likely you don&#39;t either. If you fully parse every TOS you encounter, you can stop reading right now, go straight to the nearest IHOP and have some pancakes.</p>
<p>Groups like <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/" title="IndieWeb">IndieWeb</a> are tackling data ownership issues - experimenting with ways of creating and managing content in a way that bakes in data ownership and removes the need for massive corporate services to achieve Web scale interactions. It&#39;s fun and interesting and useful... <a href="http://indiewebcamp.com/events/" title="Homebrew Website Club">we meet every two weeks, come check it out</a>! But an IndieWeb world is a long way off. Especially for non-geeks.</p>
<p>All the companies providing you services today have little interest or incentive to make ownership clear or to make your data portable - the fact that you can&#39;t easily move your data around is partially what keeps Google, Facebook, Whatsapp and Pinterest running.</p>
<p>Sure, lots of these services have APIs, through which you could access your data (or at least some of it). But regular users can&#39;t really move data around between competing services through APIs. Some of these companies have data export options, where you can download your data in a zip file, but it&#39;s not like you&#39;re doing that every day. What if today you get banned from Gmail because some process hit a false-positive while enforcing some usage policy? And when was the last time you downloaded all your stuff? Did you ever?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always wanted to move to a model where I only participate in services through my own website <strong>first</strong>, and then send a <strong>copy</strong> of my activity to Twitter, Foursquare, Bit.ly through their APIs (including in each request an extra HTTP header containing the URL to the UELA that my content is covered by!). But that will take a while to build, and won&#39;t work for devices like my Jawbone UP24 which syncs over a proprietary protocol to native apps only, finally letting me access a subset of my data through their API once it&#39;s already on their servers first.</p>
<p>So, back to the point of this post: What can you do <em>now</em>?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve started by attempting to own a copy of as much of my internet output as possible.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how I do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Google account, and install the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/drive/?hl=en" title="Google Drive App">Google Drive app</a>. This will keep a local copy of all of your Google Docs on your computer.</li>
<li>Create an <a href="https://ifttt.com" title="IFTTT">IFTTT</a> account. IFTTT is a fantastic service that allows a large number of apps, websites, services, devices and all kinds of stuff to interact with each other.</li>
<li>Set up recipes for <strong>everything</strong> you do online that&#39;s supported by IFTTT which all add to a Google Docs spreadsheet. I have recipes for Tumblr, Twitter, Bit.ly, Soundcloud and a ton more. I was very surprised by how many services have some bits of my daily personal activity.
That&#39;s it. The IFTTT triggers will start firing, the spreadsheets will start filling, and the files will be copied to your local hard drive. You&#39;ll now have both an online copy and a local backup of all the stuff you do online.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&#39;s what some of my IFTTT recipes look like:</p>
<p><a href="http://autonome.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screenshot-2014-05-06-21-17-391.png"><img src="screenshot-2014-05-06-21-17-391.png" alt="Image"></a></p>
<p>IFTTT will save it all in Google docs folder hierarchy for each service:</p>
<p><a href="http://autonome.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/screenshot-2014-05-06-21-21-58.png"><img src="screenshot-2014-05-06-21-21-58.png" alt="Image"></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be honest - it takes a little while. It&#39;s annoying to set up, even with IFTTT&#39;s excellently simple user interface. But in the end I own a copy of any new content I post to the services I use. What do I do with it? Nothing at all, right now. But someday maybe those services will shut down, or I&#39;ll get banned, or poorly implemented IT backup strategies will wipe it all out. I&#39;ll have lost nothing except the time I spent setting this up.</p>
<p>Is it real data portability? Nope. Is it true ownership? No. Hell, &quot;my&quot; content might even be under some crazy license restrictions that I agreed to before putting it up on Pocket or Evernote! But it&#39;s always running, and someday my personal weak-AI agent will be able to do something with it.</p>
<p>PS: Do you use Gmail? Do you only use the web interface or Android/iOS apps? Then you probably don&#39;t have a backup of your email. I run an IMAP mail client (Thunderbird) periodically to get an updated offline copy of my Gmail in an open format.</p>

We must, however, have the impact of a much larger entity in order to ensure that the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/" title="The Mozilla Manifesto">internet stays an open platform accessible to all</a>.</p>
<p>Producing consumer software which influences the browser and smartphone OS markets in specific ways is how we make that impact. Shipping that software requires teams of people to design, build and test it, and all the countless other aspects of the release process. We can hire some of these people, but remember: we&#39;re relatively tiny. We cannot compete with multi-billion-dollar mega-companies while operating in traditional ways. <strong>Mozilla has to be far more than the sum of its paid-employee parts in order to accomplish audaciously ambitious things.</strong></p>
<p>Open source code and open communication allow participation and contribution from people that are not employees. And this is where opportunities lie for both Mozilla and universities.</p>
<p>For universities, undergraduates can earn credit, get real world experience, and ship software to hundreds of millions of people. Graduate researchers can break ground in areas where their findings can be applied to real world problems, and where they can see the impact of their work in the hands of people around the world. And students of any kind can participate before, during and after any involvement that is formally part of their school program.</p>
<p>For Mozilla, we receive contributions that help move our products and projects forward, often in areas that aren&#39;t getting enough attention only because we don&#39;t have the resources to do so. We get an influx of new ideas and new directions. We gain awesome contributors and can educate tomorrow&#39;s technology workers about our mission.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working with a few different programs recently to increase student involvement in the Firefox OS:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/cs-469-software-engineering-capstone-i" title="PSU CS Capstone">Portland State University</a>:  </strong>The PSU CS Capstone program, run by Prof. Warren Harrison, has teams of students tackling projects for open source groups. The teams are responsible for all parts of the software life-cycle during the project. In the spring of 2013, a group of five students implemented an example messaging app using Persona and Firebase, documenting the challenges of Web platform development and the Firefox OS  development/debugging workflow. This year&#39;s group will implement a feature inside Firefox OS itself.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/facebook-open-academy-bringing-open-source-to-cs-curricula/10151806121378920" title="Facebook Open Academy">Facebook Open Academy</a>: </strong>This is a program coordinated by Stanford and Facebook, that puts teams from multiple universities together to build something proposed by an existing open source project. The Firefox OS team includes students from Carnegie-Mellon, Purdue, Harvard, Columbia in the US, and Tampere UT in Finland. They&#39;re adding a new feature to Firefox OS which allows you to share apps directly between devices using NFC and Bluetooth. With 14 members across five universities, this team is collaborating via Github, Google Groups, IRC and weekly meetings for both the front-end and back-end parts, providing experience with remote working, group coordination and cross-team collaboration.</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao/" title="UMich Prof. Mao">University of Michigan</a>: </strong>Prof. Z. Morley Mao&#39;s mobile research group has started looking at device and network performance in Firefox OS. They&#39;ve got a stack of phones and SIM cards, and we&#39;re working with them to find ways to improve battery life and network efficiency on our devices. They&#39;ve started <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/FirefoxOS/Research" title="Firefox OS Research">a collection of focus areas and related research</a> on the Mozilla wiki.
If you&#39;re at an academic institution and would like to learn more about how to get your department or your students involved, or if you&#39;re a Mozillian who wants to coordinate a project with your alma mater, <a href="mailto:dietrich@mozilla.com">email me</a>!</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>Mozilla has ~1000 employees. According to Wikipedia, Google has ~50,000 employees, Apple ~80,000 and Microsoft ~100,000.</li>
