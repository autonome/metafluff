Parsers like Xerces have dramatically grown in size and have performance problem due to the fact that validation is built in the parser.   </p>
<p>To me, parsing and validating are two different activities. They may have  </p>
<p>been integrated for performance reasons of the parsing+validation pipeline,  </p>
<p>but I&#39;d still like to have a clean, high performance parsing pipeline in  </p>
<p>which I could plugin any kind of validators (eg. Sun MSV).  </p>
<p>Take the bug that causes Xerces 2 to dereference and parse schemas even if  </p>
<p>validation is disabled for example. I hope it has been fixed since, but if Xerces 2 was not mixing a lot of APIs and technologies (parsing, validating, building a DTD specific DOMs, etc.) in a monolithic way, the bug would have never appeared in the first place.&quot;<a href="">Link</a>  </p>

If everybody flew naked, not only would you never have to worry about the passenger next to you carrying box cutters or exploding shoes, but no religious fundamentalists of any stripe would ever be caught dead flying nude, or in the presence of nude women, and that alone would keep many potential hijackers out of the skies. It&#39;s much more civilized than racial profiling. And I&#39;m sure that it wouldn&#39;t be long before airlines would be offering free dry-cleaning for your clothes while you fly.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/26/opinion/26FRIE.html">Link</a>  </p>

The armed forces are always looking to gain decision superiority apparently, and now I want to as well. I think that would be really helpful in most situations.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Another expression used yesterday that I loved came from Cory Doctorow in his &quot;A New Way of Understanding P2P&quot; presentation. He talked about the concept of an imagination proposition, or the idea that people get involved in something simply because it&#39;s interesting. An example he stated was the huge number of people involved in SETI@home vs. P2P projects searching for cures for AIDS or cancer. While the value proposition for an AIDS cure is higher than the search for extraterrestrial life, it&#39;s simply more interesting to people to dedicate their spare CPU cycles to the search for aliens. Imagination proposition.&quot;<a href="">Link</a>  </p>

<p>I came here to Apache thinking that I was different, that I had better ideas, that I could shape things on my own, and I continued to think that until very recently... but I look around and see a bunch of people that I care about, a bunch of people that I consider friends, a community of equal individuals, in all possible senses.   </p>
<p>Only when I saw that I knew what to do: delegate, let go, let others step in, let others understand this by themselves (good software comes out as a byproduct of our path to learn it)   </p>
<p>This is my suggestion for all of you, even for you experienced members: delegation scales the community and a bigger community means more value,   </p>
<p>more fun, more positive energy. But delegation happens only if you trust, if you consider your fellow community mate equal to you.   </p>
<p>When this doesn&#39;t happen, friction develops, bottlenecks arise, positive energy turns into negative one.   </p>
<p>Just think about it and return on it often: you are never far enough from your ego to be safe.<a href="">Link</a>  </p>
