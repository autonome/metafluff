Yes, I know: a trivial annoyance. However, to quote Joel Spolsky, from his book <em>User Interface Design for Programmers</em>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even something that seems like a tiny, inconsequential frustration affects your mood. Your emotions don&#39;t seem to care about the magnitude of the event, only the quality. ... I started to learn that the days when I was happiest were the days with a lot of small successes and few small frustrations. So, here&#39;s a solution to a small frustration: <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/nfqf/">nfqf</a> - a filtering search for your Netflix queue. It&#39;s a <a href="http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/">Greasemonkey</a> script that adds a little search box at the top of your queue. Type characters in, and your queue will only show movies w/ titles that contain that string of characters.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/nfqf/nfqf.user.js">Install</a>    </p>
<p>Caveat emptor: I&#39;m not responsible for any malfunctions that may occur due to Netflix changing their site, or your decision to trust my ineptitude.  </p>

<p>From hanging out in #calendar on irc.mozilla.org, it appeared that most Lightning dev was happening on Windows, which meant that there weren&#39;t any nightly builds for us Mac users.</p>
<p>Building was surprisingly easy... and unsurprisingly long. The attached shot shows what it looks like so far.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll flex it&#39;s functionality when I get time, and will post about that as well. If you&#39;re brave/stupid, and want a copy of the xpi, let me know.</p>

It allows some hybrid cars to drive in the carpool lane, even if the vehicle has a single occupant. However, carpool lanes are funded by federal grants, and the federal government threatened to take away their funding if California allowed this law to take effect. The implementation of the law was <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/content/news/traffic/story/13322796p-14164921c.html">postponed indefinitely</a>.  </p>
<p>The opposition to California&#39;s law was spearheaded by domestic auto manufacturers, <a href="http://www.freep.com/money/autonews/ford25e_20040825.htm">who consider AB2628 a &quot;buy japanese&quot; bill</a>. This is because domestically manufactured hybrid vehicles get far less miles-per-gallon than the Japanese hybrids, and don&#39;t satisfy the requirements of the bill.  </p>
<p>In a positive development, the federal transportation bill which was just signed into law by <a href="http://www.whitehouse.com/">El Presidento Nepotsis</a> (nsfw), allows hybrids in federally-funded carpool lanes. The California ARB (Air Resources Board) have already updated <a href="http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/carpool/carpool.htm">their website</a>, adding a number of hybrid models to the list of single-occupant vehicles that qualify as able to drive in the carpool lane.  </p>
<p>What&#39;s the effect on hybrid-driving commuters like myself? Well, here in southern California it means that the commute might be 5-10 minutes shorter. Yay. Now it should only take 55 minutes to drive 32 miles, instead of the usual hour.  </p>
<p>The importance of this law taking effect is not about the commute however. It sends a message to domestic auto manufacturers, who have been working overtime for years to prevent mass-adoption of fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly cars in America: Fuck you.  </p>

<p>So in any place in your Firefox extension where you previously used a GUID to uniquely represent your extension, you can now use your email address.</p>
<p>I really don&#39;t know more than that, as it was just mentioned in <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/blog/wp-admin/post.php#//mozilla.org#umo">irc://mozilla.org#umo</a> (is that how you represent an irc channel in a URL?) but I haven&#39;t looked into it further.</p>
<p>I wonder how they handle authors with multiple extensions? Or how about when you change your email address? Also, guids are kinda anonymous. Emails have owners... I wonder if they do any kind of send/reply validation...</p>

<p>platforms, and technologies.&quot; Now <em>that&#39;s</em> what I&#39;m talkin bout. But  </p>
<p>like any one of these interoperability groups, we&#39;ll have to wait and  </p>
