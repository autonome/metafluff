<p>I&#39;m on the developer relations team at Mozilla. The &quot;devrel&quot; role has many parts, but generally means communicating to developers about web technologies important to Mozilla and <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/">our mission</a>, and being an advocate for developers in our product development process.</p>
<p>I spent 2017 on typical developer relations activities - coding, writing, speaking - but entirely in UTC+5 and higher timezones. I&#39;d lived in Asia before, and learned how much <em>presence</em> matters in order to learn about a place, and also I wanted to reduce my carbon footprint by not flying back and forth across mega-oceans.</p>
<p>From a &quot;devrel at Mozilla&quot; perspective, I had specific reasons for doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/top20.htm">largest internet populations are in Asia</a>, as well as the largest <em>offline populations</em>. We need to be where the users are, and where growth will happen in the future.</li>
<li>It&#39;s estimated that <a href="https://www.inc.com/will-yakowicz/shenzhen-city-of-electronics.html">~90% of the world&#39;s electronics are manufactured in Shenzen, China</a>. If we want to make a safer internet, then Shenzhen is a place we <em>must</em> be.</li>
<li>I wanted to learn about how technology decision making is happening - by developers, or otherwise, in as many different communities in Asia as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ll be publishing a series of briefs on what I learned this year about things like mobile payment patterns and the rise of physical computing, the transient nature of mobile web task workflows, where technical decision making happens, the relationship between the web and messaging apps, cultural and community verticalism, timezone bias, app investor ecosystem, ethical echo-chambers, Chinese maker spaces, a survey of noodle soups across Asia, and more.</p>
<p>But first, here&#39;s my 2017 in review.</p>
<h2 id="firsts">Firsts</h2>
<p>It was a year with a few firsts:</p>
<ul>
<li>First keynote speaking appearances, three different events, each very different from the other.</li>
<li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14823807">First time at #1 on Hacker News</a></li>
<li>First press briefings, in Taipei and Singapore</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~dietrich">First modules published on NPM!</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
<p>In 2017, I spoke at or facilitated 22 events in 12 different countries.</p>
<p>I specifically chose a diverse set of events, in an effort to learn about communities of technology decision-making outside the typical web developer or open source events. I spoke to high school and university students, designers, developers, open source die-hards, startup founders, entrepreneurs, investors, device manufacturers, academics, and people in various levels and roles in governments.</p>
<p>Some of the speaking happened because I submitted a proposal to conference CFPs, some from events reaching out to Mozilla for a speaker, some because I reached out to the organizer asking to speak, some from just being present and offering to speak, and one because I had a drink with a friend who introduced me to another friend whose dad ran a conference and thought I&#39;d be a good match.</p>

<h2 id="intent-to-ship">Intent To Ship</h2>
<p>Early in 2017 I scratched an itch I&#39;d been having around the &quot;Intent to...&quot; messages on Mozilla&#39;s dev.platform mailing list, and Blink&#39;s blink-dev mailing list. These &quot;intent&quot; messages are sent when either of these engines is changing their implementation of the web platform. These messages are extremely useful for communication between the browser vendors - which was validated by how quickly the tweets from this account got picked up by key members of Gecko and Blink development teams, being retweeted and favorited regularly.</p>
<p>Now, nine months after starting the account, it has only ~1600 followers, but they are largely influencers in web/browser devrel, or web platform implementors. And the tweets from the account had 375k impressions in the last month, according to Twitter&#39;s analytics.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>
<p>Around the <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/11/14/introducing-firefox-quantum/">Quantum launch</a> I started some work around performance testing, digging into some low-level performance characteristics of Firefox while running the <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/arewefastyet-speedometer/2.0/">Speedometer 2.0 benchmark</a>. It resulted in some handy cross-browser automation tooling - I implemented part of Chrome&#39;s Puppeteer API in Node.js.</p>
<p>Once it was easy to run Speedometer with multiple browsers and different versions, I added some measurements of things like CPU usage and disk IO. The work isn&#39;t done yet, but the most interesting learning yet is that it&#39;s beginning to look like the <em>quantity of writes</em>, irrespective of the amount of data, is the determining factor in performance on Mac for this particular test. More to come in 2018 on this.</p>

<h2 id="speech-recognition">Speech Recognition</h2>
<p>I worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/andrenatalbr">Andre Natal</a> to take the work done in the <a href="https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/voice-fill">Voice Fill Test Pilot experiment for Firefox</a>, and make it accessible to developers both for web and Node.js use.</p>
<p>Voice Fill is an extension, which uses a cloud-based speech recognition service run by Mozilla. It&#39;s a <em>private</em> cloud service - not connected to any type of account, and no audio is saved on our servers.</p>
<p>This means that developers who want to add speech recognition to their web pages, apps and devices can do so without having to buy into a cloud provider ecosystem.</p>
<p>I started by modularizing the extension code into a single library for web pages.</p>
<ul>
<li>Source is at <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/speaktome-web">speaktome-web on Github</a></li>
<li>Module is at <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/speaktome-api">speaktome-api on NPM</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also wrote a module for using the service from Node.js in your own devices - a RaspberryPi with a USB microphone, for example. This was a fun jaunt through the various libraries that deal with mics and recording and codecs and I only cried a little bit. But it works pretty well now, so time well spent.</p>

<h2 id="webextensions">WebExtensions</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve been writing browser extensions for Firefox since 2005, and in 2017 Mozilla made the biggest change in how extensions are written since they were initially added to the browser: The WebExtensions API. It&#39;s a change that sets the stage for Firefox to be much faster and safer while still being customizable. I spent some time migrating some of the extensions I&#39;d written that I just couldn&#39;t live without, and also doing some experimentation with making new browser APIs and a few more experiments.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tab hiding</em>: The tab groups extension needs an API for hiding and showing tabs, so I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/autonome/webext-experiment-showOnlyTheseTabs">experimental version of that API</a>.</li>
<li><em>Dormancy</em>: Once the tab.discard API was implemented, I ported Dormancy, an extension that unloads the web content in tabs after five minutes of not being used. <a href="https://github.com/autonome/Dormancy">Source code on Github</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dormancy/">AMO listing</a></li>
<li><em>Peek</em>: An experiment in quick access to web content without breaking the user workflow. <a href="https://github.com/autonome/Peek">Source code on Github</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/peek/">AMO listing</a></li>
<li><em>Tab Statistics</em>: Extensions for showing different statistics about how you use tabs. It is implemented as a single extension, but since WebExtensions only allows a single menu item per extension, I listed four different versions on AMO, each showing a different piece of information. <a href="https://github.com/autonome/tabstatistics">Source code on Github</a><ul>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-count-button/">Tab Count on AMO</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabs-opened-button/">Tabs Opened on AMO</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabs-closed-button/">Tabs Closed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabs-switched-button/">Tab Switches</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Force Google Locale</em>: Detect your locale, and add it to Google URLs. <a href="https://github.com/autonome/forcegooglelocale">Source code on Github</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/force-google-locale/">AMO listing</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="miscellanous-projects">Miscellanous Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Web and Messaging</em>: Research exploring how the web and messaging apps can play together. <a href="https://github.com/autonome/web-and-messaging">Research on Github</a></li>
<li><em>TreeViewSortable</em>: An extension for the Atom Editor for sorting the file tree in different ways. <a href="https://github.com/autonome/tree-view-sortable">Source code on Github</a></li>
<li><em>Twitter Inline Oembed</em>: Embed Tweets in a single line of code in your blog posts. <a href="https://github.com/autonome/twitter-inline-oembed">Source code on Github</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter-inline-oembed">On NPM</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>While I had a few posts that I really liked and were successful, I really thought I&#39;d write more this year, and am disappointed by how little I managed to publish. I have a huge number of partially completed posts in my drafts folder. I need to create a habit of flexing the writing muscle regularly.</p>
<p>The big traffic post was about my absurd number of tabs. I did some basic performance testing across a bunch of versions of Firefox, which showed dramatic improvements in startup time even with more than 1000 tabs. I really didn&#39;t expect such a response - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14823807">#1 on HackerNews</a> (537 comments!), coverage by loads of mainstream tech news outlets like <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/firefox-can-open-over-1500-tabs-in-15-seconds/">ZDNET</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6otuw7/the_new_firefox_and_ridiculous_numbers_of_tabs/">pretty massive comment thread on /r/programming</a>.</p>

The difference is amazing - the conference has grown to be one of the largest open source events in Asia, with more than <a href="http://2017.fossasia.org/speakers.html">200 speakers</a> over three days across 13 tracks and now hosted in Singapore.</p>
<script src="//unpkg.com/twitter-inline-oembed@0.0.1/oembed.js?tweet=https://twitter.com/dietrich/status/842543000320335873"></script>

<p>The conference is entirely open source and volunteer-run, which is really neat. Kudos to the organizers for putting it on, which is a huge amount of work. The focus on free and open source software and tracks on relevant topics like AI, Bitcoin, and IoT combine to make a great collection of people to put in one place for a weekend.</p>
<script src="//unpkg.com/twitter-inline-oembed@0.0.1/oembed.js?tweet=https://twitter.com/dietrich/status/842638503473233921"></script>

<p>Mozilla didn&#39;t directly sponsor this year, but instead sent some of our Tech Speakers who had talks accepted and myself. We were seven people from six countries, speaking about VR, WebAssembly, Web-RTC, security, IoT, AR and more. Big thanks to Bob Reyes, Diky Arga Anggara, Noritada Shimizu, Santosh Viswanatham, Shah Mijanur Rahman and Trishul Goel for speaking at the conference and putting in a bunch of hours at our table every day.</p>
<script src="//unpkg.com/twitter-inline-oembed@0.0.1/oembed.js?tweet=https://twitter.com/dietrich/status/843647232393924609"></script>

<p>The number of speakers was enough of a presence to earn us a table in the exhibition hall, so we took advantage of the opportunity and demo&#39;d A-Frame VR and AR on mobile devices for all three days.</p>
<p>The response was <em>fantastic</em> - lots of people having their first VR experience of any kind, and everyone was mindblown that the demos were built using web technologies, running in a browser, and on a mobile phone.</p>

<p>After three days of rapping with everyone who came by the booth, here are a few impressions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most people, developers included, haven&#39;t strongly engaged in VR yet. If you assume everyone is doing it, you&#39;re probably in the VR industry and you&#39;re wrong. I&#39;ve been demoing VR at conferences for the last couple of years and I always ask if people have tried it before and the answer is usually &quot;no&quot;. VR may be in the limelight in tech news, but the on-the-ground experience says it&#39;s still very early days.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A-Frame has excellent name recognition. This conversation a lot: &quot;This was made with a JavaScript library called A-Frame.&quot; &quot;Oh, A-Frame!&quot; &quot;You&#39;ve used it?&quot; &quot;No, but I&#39;ve heard of it and it looks awesome!&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Almost nobody was talking about bots.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Almost everybody was talking about AI and machine learning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People are <em>still</em> asking us about Firefox OS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conference">Conference</h2>
<p>What I liked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great crowd. It really feels like a practitioners conference where people are learning reciprocally.</li>
<li>Talk topics are really good. Very little fluff on the schedule. Great mix of interesting and practical topics. Good job by organizers here.</li>
<li>Excellent conference website and apps. They&#39;re writing their own FOSS event management stack, and it seems pretty great so far.</li>
<li>Communication from organizers prior to the event was really good. Combination of emails for important things, and Google Group and Slack for general communication really worked well.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&#39;d like to see next year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers should not have to pay for tickets.</li>
<li>Need a venue that&#39;s centrally located, easier to navigate and that lets attendees focus on the conference.</li>
<li>Singapore already has lots of events, and is famously expensive for hotel and venue space. To make a truly pan-Asian conference, should move around to different cities.</li>
<li>The schedule was changed at the last minute without warning to speakers, causing some to miss their talks. Need to lock the schedule down, and communicate changes very clearly.</li>
<li>Day two and three each have <em>15</em> tracks! I&#39;d prefer to see a smaller and more focused set of tracks.</li>
