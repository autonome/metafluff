He works at <a href="http://vidoop.com/">Vidoop</a>, and is the developer of <a href="http://ineedtoreadthis.com/">ineedtoreadthis.com</a>. We were talking at BarCamp about how there&#39;s a lot of Firefox extension development going on, but usually by lone individuals. For instance, many of the extension developers I interact with say the same thing: &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m <em>the</em> person at my company who&#39;s in charge of the extension&quot;. And while there&#39;s a lot of great online resources for extension developers, there&#39;s no local group or meet-up specific to development using the Mozilla platform.</p>
<p>Hence the PDX Firefox Developers Group! If you&#39;re interested in developing Firefox extensions, or hacking Firefox itself, or are already doing so, come out and meet others doing the same. For the first meeting, Ben is going to talk about his <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pdx-firefox-dev/msg/40b71d5ab74c0db9">unit test framework for extensions</a>, and I&#39;m going to talk about <a href="http://ubiquity.mozilla.com/">Ubiquity</a>, a Mozilla Labs project. I&#39;d like it to be more focused on the hacking than lecturing, so bring your laptop! For example, I&#39;ll walk through the process of writing a new Ubiquity command. Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pdx-firefox-dev">PDX-Firefox-Dev Google group</a> for ongoing talk about Firefox and Mozilla hacking, or if you have topics you&#39;d like to talk about at the meet-ups.</p>
<p>The group is meeting on the second Wednesday of the month. The first meeting is next Wednesday, May 13th, and is taking place at <a href="http://www.nedspace.com/">Nedspace</a> (directions below) at 7pm. We&#39;ll probably roll somewhere near for drinks afterwards. Please <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2620820/">RSVP on Upcoming</a>.</p>

Overall, a fantastic experience. I would go back in a heartbeat, if only my heart (and wallet) could take that kind of a beating regularly.</p>
<p>Soup</p>
<p>The soup was cucumber and creme fraiche, was airy and cool; some citrus high notes with the cucumber keeping things steady. The flower petals were a beautiful contrast. The chili oil was... missing. Others said they could taste it, but I couldn&#39;t. It would&#39;ve provided perfect dissonance, as well as a textural anchor on the tongue, so my <em>hunch</em> is that it was intended to be drizzled on top, but was forgotten. It was paired with a Gruner Veltliner, worked fine.</p>
<p>Charcuterie</p>
<p>Foie gras bon-bon: Unbelievable on the tongue, but a bit too worshipful. I come from peasant stock, and wanted to eat this on some country bread.</p>
<p>Steak tartare and quail egg on toast: Undoubtedly a highlight of the meal. The tartare was supremely cold with maybe some... scallion and white pepper? I had a minor yolk-splosion, so best to take it all in one bite.</p>
<p>Pork Rillette and house cracker: High expections went unmet. The pork was unnassuming, and the cracker could&#39;ve been crisper.</p>
<p>Duck, duck liver, cherry and pistachio pate: A nice blend of creamy and roasty. I&#39;m just not a fan of mixing fruit, nuts <em>and</em> meat, so it wasn&#39;t my favorite. Also, my less-than-blue blood again was begging for bread or a cracker.</p>
<p>There was also a cornichon on a daub of dijon mustard, a crisp &quot;ice leaf&quot; (IIRC) on a sliced pea salad, and a salami.</p>
<p>All of this was paired with Tessier Cheverny Blanc - wonderful choice: front of the tongue, spicy, light.<em> </em></p>
<p>Entree</p>
<p>The  seared duck breast, alongside a cherry and tomato salsa and pan-fried squash blossoms. The duck was fairly unadorned, which was a great move given it&#39;s place in the courses - nice to focus on purity after the charcuterie carnival. The salsa was more of a salad: Rainier cherries and cherry tomatoes halved and in a mild vinegar. It stood up for itself next to the duck.</p>
<p>The only downer of the course was the Grosbois Vielles Chinon that was the paired with it. Maybe they intentionally chose a wine that would get out of the way... or maybe it was just unremarkable. The duck cried out for a saltier, earthy red - I&#39;d have chosen a tempranillo maybe.</p>
<p>Salad</p>
<p>Oddly, this was the simplest part of the meal, yet all agreed that it vied for a top spot among the courses. It was some local greens and a few peach slices in a sherry vinaigrette. There were marcona almonds, but as they were whole, they were bystanders. The upstaging of the course was the shaved goat cheese. The shameless creamy sourness of goat cheese, perfectly distributed via micro-shavings, hooked up with the sherry, and ravished those damn greens. Playing the excited voyeur was the  Salomon Kogl Riesling - light on the tongue and a nice balance to the piquancy of the sherry.</p>
<p>Cheese</p>
<p>Steve&#39;s cheese - one slice each of a sheep, goat and cow cheese, with poached apricots, candied hazelnuts, saffron shortbread and local honeycomb. The sheep&#39;s cheese stood out - with a broad nuttiness, definitely was the best choice to contrast the preceding course. The shortbread were little buttons, well-sized to reign in the saffron&#39;s tendency to dominate. The honeycomb was what really took this course over the edge, into the realm of culinary primality - a chthonic offering spilt on the civilized craftsmanship of the cheeses.</p>
<p>The Prieler pinot blanc was well paired, provided respite for an overstimulated palate.</p>
<p>Dessert</p>
<p>Lemon verbena meringues with buttermilk ice cream and tayberries and blackberries. The meringue was truly enjoyable, bright and sweet. The wine pairing was JJ Christoffel Urziger Wurzgarten Auslese, and was far too thickly sweet to be served with buttermilk ice cream. We were offered coffee, which was the right choice for this course... but then left us with wine and coffee at the same time, which was awkward.</p>
<p>Tips: The portions were perfect, and the progression of courses was well thought out, so I&#39;d recommend going for all six courses. The wine pairing, with a couple of exceptions, was smart, so I recommend that as well. Go for the second seating, as you&#39;ll get more time to linger.</p>

One of the founders, <a href="http://www.adamduvander.com/">Adam Duvander</a> (of <a href="http://www.bestplaces.net/">Best Places</a> and <a href="http://www.wifipdx.com/">WifiPDX</a>), invited me to come speak about <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox3">Firefox 3</a>. I was told that the turnout was 3x normal, which was cool. <a href="http://www.isitedesign.com/">iSite Design</a> provided the venue, and the pizza, thanks y&#39;all :)</p>
<p>My <a href="http://dietrich.ganx4.com/mozilla/Fx3-WebInnovators.pdf">hastily-made presentation</a> is basically an overview of the user-facing features planned for Fx3 (with Schrep&#39;s #&#39;s slide thrown in to end on). Here are some impressions and take-aways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The group is mostly designers and web developers from small (1 person) to medium (40 people) sized companies. There were some independent contractors, and a few other people from various software/web-related fields.</li>
<li>People seemed generally interested in the &quot;information management&quot; stuff: places, microformats, content handling.</li>
<li>Significant crowd reaction when i said we&#39;d fix the &quot;save password only <em>after</em> a successful logon&quot; bug :)</li>
<li>Unsurprisingly, there was concern about how many new features there were. Several people asked whether the new features would be able to turned off entirely. Questions about whether &quot;the old simpler Firefox&quot; would still be available.</li>
<li>Also unsurprising was the general concern about performance and memory usage.</li>
<li>People were curious about developing both Firefox extensions and XULRunner apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>I might do a follow-up presentation on Fx3 for Developers.

It was put on by the <a href="http://www.nwcrc.org/">NWCRC</a> and <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/">PFAW</a>, and featured a professor/lawyer, a lawyer handling a case against the government over warrant-less wiretapping, and an activist.</p>
<p>It was f*ckin&#39; scary.</p>
<p>But it was also extremely interesting, and at times even funny. It&#39;s inspiring and humbling to see these smart and talented people out there fighting our government&#39;s encroachments on our rights, on a daily basis. And it&#39;s uplifting to see that it&#39;s possible to keep a sense of humor while doing it... because if we can no longer laugh, then the fascists have truly won.</p>
<p>Yes, you are under surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>DANCE!</strong></p>
