The difference is amazing - the conference has grown to be one of the largest open source events in Asia, with more than <a href="http://2017.fossasia.org/speakers.html">200 speakers</a> over three days across 13 tracks and now hosted in Singapore.</p>

<p>The conference is entirely open source and volunteer-run, which is really neat. Kudos to the organizers for putting it on, which is a huge amount of work. The focus on free and open source software and tracks on relevant topics like AI, Bitcoin, and IoT combine to make a great collection of people to put in one place for a weekend.</p>

<p>Mozilla didn&#39;t directly sponsor this year, but instead sent some of our Tech Speakers who had talks accepted and myself. We were seven people from six countries, speaking about VR, WebAssembly, Web-RTC, security, IoT, AR and more. Big thanks to Bob Reyes, Diky Arga Anggara, Noritada Shimizu, Santosh Viswanatham, Shah Mijanur Rahman and Trishul Goel for speaking at the conference and putting in a bunch of hours at our table every day.</p>

<p>The number of speakers was enough of a presence to earn us a table in the exhibition hall, so we took advantage of the opportunity and demo&#39;d A-Frame VR and AR on mobile devices for all three days.</p>
<p>The response was <em>fantastic</em> - lots of people having their first VR experience of any kind, and everyone was mindblown that the demos were built using web technologies, running in a browser, and on a mobile phone.</p>

<p>After three days of rapping with everyone who came by the booth, here are a few impressions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Most people, developers included, haven&#39;t strongly engaged in VR yet. If you assume everyone is doing it, you&#39;re probably in the VR industry and you&#39;re wrong. I&#39;ve been demoing VR at conferences for the last couple of years and I always ask if people have tried it before and the answer is usually &quot;no&quot;. VR may be in the limelight in tech news, but the on-the-ground experience says it&#39;s still very early days.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A-Frame has excellent name recognition. This conversation a lot: &quot;This was made with a JavaScript library called A-Frame.&quot; &quot;Oh, A-Frame!&quot; &quot;You&#39;ve used it?&quot; &quot;No, but I&#39;ve heard of it and it looks awesome!&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Almost nobody was talking about bots.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Almost everybody was talking about AI and machine learning.</p>
</li>
<li><p>People are <em>still</em> asking us about Firefox OS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conference">Conference</h2>
<p>What I liked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Great crowd. It really feels like a practitioners conference where people are learning reciprocally.</li>
<li>Talk topics are really good. Very little fluff on the schedule. Great mix of interesting and practical topics. Good job by organizers here.</li>
<li>Excellent conference website and apps. They&#39;re writing their own FOSS event management stack, and it seems pretty great so far.</li>
<li>Communication from organizers prior to the event was really good. Combination of emails for important things, and Google Group and Slack for general communication really worked well.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I&#39;d like to see next year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speakers should not have to pay for tickets.</li>
<li>Need a venue that&#39;s centrally located, easier to navigate and that lets attendees focus on the conference.</li>
<li>Singapore already has lots of events, and is famously expensive for hotel and venue space. To make a truly pan-Asian conference, should move around to different cities.</li>
<li>The schedule was changed at the last minute without warning to speakers, causing some to miss their talks. Need to lock the schedule down, and communicate changes very clearly.</li>
<li>Day two and three each have <em>15</em> tracks! I&#39;d prefer to see a smaller and more focused set of tracks.</li>
</ul>
