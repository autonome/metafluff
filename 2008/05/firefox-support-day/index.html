<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve had my head in the Firefox 3 sand for a <em>long</em> time. Trying.. to remember.. how to.. talk..</li>
<li>SUMO is <em>fantastic</em>. I had no idea what it was until today... and I am ashamed for that.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.djst.org/blog/">David Tenser</a> is truly a gentleman.</li>
<li>Live screen-sharing with audio... worldwide... free... on the web, is a PAIN. We did not accomplish this, and resorted to a phone conference for audio.
It&#39;s nice to be out in society again. Who knows, maybe I&#39;ll even blog more.</li>
