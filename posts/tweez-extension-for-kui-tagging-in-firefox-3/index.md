Tweez is a simple keyboard-oriented extension to Firefox 3 that allows you to rapidly tag the page currently visible.

**[Install](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6353)**

*   Requires Firefox 3 Beta 2 or greater.
*   Shift+T to tag
*   Esc or Enter to leave

Tweez is a hacky low-budget attempt to scratch an itch. Expect bugs, especially focus problems. Maybe someday it'll be cool like [Alex's vision](http://people.mozilla.com/~faaborg/files/20070705-kui/i1kuiTagging.png_large.png).
