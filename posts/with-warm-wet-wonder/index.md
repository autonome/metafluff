Um...  

"Summoning Spring   

With melodic frolic I call to you, oh good goddess broad of the world - Bring in the spring with warm wet wonder... Bring in the spring with blossomed peaceful awareness...Bring in the spring with gleaming gusto, bust out the bold brilliant beams of green and take us out to the streams so we can walk free and live feverishly. Bring out the lusty musky love gun and shoot us up with new romance and sexy slow dancing fairies that pierce our heart with sexified sugarlumps. Come on in and come lovely.  

Sweeping love across the screen with letters pressed together that form sentient sentences saying, hey, I truly am grateful to have music in my life and to be able to bring some light onto this sometimes dark and scary world.  

With deep mental massage,  

- Amy"[Link](http://theamysteinbergband.com/)
