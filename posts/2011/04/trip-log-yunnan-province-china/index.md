*   Hour and half flight from Chiang Mai.
*   Taxi ride: [Volkswagen jetta](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623891907/in/set-72157626489333032), driver has cage around himself, shouting into the phone the whole ride

4/3 A day in Kunming

*   The gambay lesson was hard learned. Hurty head.
*   Electric scooters are silent and everywhere. I'm sure people get hit all the time because they don't hear them.
*   The whole city seems quiet and clean. Not Hanoi. Alek says this is a new phenomenon.
*   Sim card for 15USD. GPRS 500mb 15USD. GPRS is fast here. 3G advertised everywhere in the whole country. Never worked for me though.
*   Tried to get a camera charger. Guy at cellphone shop called a guy, who delivered it there in 10 minutes. Didn't work though. [The shop had some great phone brands that'll look familiar to you](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624488710/in/set-72157626489333032).
*   [Over The Bridge noodles](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623892757/in/set-72157626489333032) at the [Brothers Jiang](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624487342/in/set-72157626489333032). [This shit had BEES in it](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623893289/in/set-72157626489333032). Very interesting.
*   [Golden horse emerald chicken park](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623902145/in/set-72157626489333032). Yeah, that's it's full name.
*   [Huge walking mall, many many city blocks](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623923247/in/set-72157626489333032). With fancy stores and [a fashion show](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624511458/in/set-72157626489333032).
*   Needed coffee. [Only could find McDonalds](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624495172/in/set-72157626489333032). Sad.
*   [A bunch of skaters outside](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623913915/in/set-72157626489333032). [9 year-old smoking cigarettes while he skates](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623907789/in/set-72157626489333032).
*   Btw, everyone has these tea containers with a filter of geniusness built-in. I got one. And then lost it.
*   Went to a big park, where lots of people were outside [making music](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624518602/in/set-72157626489333032), dancing, singing. There were [cool water toys](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623930563/in/set-72157626489333032), and [scary dolls](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624523504/in/set-72157626489333032) [to ride](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5623932761/in/set-72157626489333032), and [proximity-detecting automated garbage cans](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624516602/in/set-72157626489333032).
*   Found a little local joint for dinner. A bunch of the patrons were the musicians from the park. The food was again epic - [many kinds of veggie and mushroom dishes, cured pork, soup](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5624529052/in/set-72157626489333032/).
4/4 Zhongdian

*   Saw what can only be described as "megahousing" developments outside of Kunming.
*   Factories everywhere, in suburbs outside the city. Saw a red cloud over a valley of factories. Red.
*   Oh look, that is a road. On a cliff along the river. How. The. Hell.
*   Himalayan mountains in the distance? Easily twice as tall as the giant mountains we're flying over.
*   Land in Zhongdian. Small airport, but clearly new. Full of Tibetan items, and cold-weather gear. It's COLD.
*   One hour flight, landing at 12,000ft above sea-level. Yeah, we all ended up with mild altitude sickness for the first day. That kinda sucked.
*   Zhongdian was renamed Shangri-La 10 years ago to increase tourism.
*   [Yak fields on the way to town.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615598577/in/set-72157626364130939)
*   More Jetta cabs. Must be state-mandated.
*   Populace is Tibetan mostly, but many other ethnic minorities present.
*   Pink hat ladies! Scarf tied around hats.
*   Old town. [Cobblestone streets. Carved wood structures.](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615582667/in/set-72157626364130939)
*   Fashion for guys is like 80s bad boy. Or black blazer and slacks... for doing manual labor.
*   Women wearing slave-to-fashion wear, or traditional garb. Not much in between.
*   Lunch spots advertise with [bao steamers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616165496/in/set-72157626364130939). Ate at [East City North Cooked Wheaten Food King](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615585881/in/set-72157626364130939). Had [three](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616246102/in/set-72157626364130939) [noodle](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616248414/in/set-72157626364130939) [soups](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616249732/in/set-72157626364130939). With yak meat. And [dumplings](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615666431/in/set-72157626364130939).
*   Land of no salad. Seriously, there's almost no fresh vegetables in any food we had the whole trip. Always cooked.
*   Last day of Cleaning the Grave holiday. [Half the town was in the graveyard](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615712971/in/set-72157626364130939) as we checked in, lighting off firecrackers by the grave.
*   Checked into the guesthouse. No inside heat in the guesthouses.
*   Meet Alek's friend Meow Meow (sp?)
*   No running water for 4 months during winter because pipes are frozen.
*   Nightly dancing in both the old-town center, and new-town center. They like to dance.
*   New hotels in new town. I bet they have heat and running water and power all year round.
*   [Little Potala palace](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616301024/in/set-72157626364130939). [Megatemple of Tibetan Buddhism](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616367732/in/set-72157626364130939).

*   Yak butter tea. Yak snacks (aka jerky).
*   Tibetan dinner. Creaky wooden restaurant. Cold, only space-heaters. [Yak SASHIMI](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643084959/in/set-72157626364130939), square noodle soup, meat pie (ground yak).

*   Rented bikes, [rode 20km around a lake](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615856257/in/set-72157626364130939).

*   [We let some kids ride our bikes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613465482/in/set-72157626364130939).
*   [I got to fly my kite!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5615974961/in/set-72157626364130939)
*   [Lunch](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616563638/in/set-72157626364130939). I love this place.
*   [Local market](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613008541/in/set-72157626364130939). [Tibetan bacon](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616003097/in/set-72157626364130939). [Tea](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616008295/in/set-72157626364130939). [Chilis](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616597884/in/set-72157626364130939). [Entrails](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616015793/in/set-72157626364130939). [Bells](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616017887/in/set-72157626364130939).
*   [This lady loved Shiloh's hat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616591884/in/set-72157626364130939).
*   [Prayer wheel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643644670/in/set-72157626364130939). [Again, with the giantism](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643079047/in/set-72157626364130939). Billions of "ohm mani padmi ohms" per spin. Must do odd number of spins.
*   Hot pot dinner with Meow Meow. One [pot of yak](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616044483/in/set-72157626364130939), and one of ["home" chicken](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616628592/in/set-72157626364130939) (aka free range. ish.). [Owner wanted to wear Shiloh's hat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616629592/in/set-72157626364130939).
*   Soccer bar. Owner was huge Spain/Barca fan. Left him my Pique jersey to put on the wall. Power went out in all of old town, [so we drank by candlelight](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643656124/in/set-72157626364130939).
*   Oh, and the power outage? That means no heated blankets in our not-heated room tonight.
4/6 Zhongdian, Tiger Leaping Gorge

*   Hey, the blankets were quite effective, probably yak wool.
*   Bus to Tiger Leaping Gorge.
*   The hike starts with a nice meandering valley stroll, and [nice views](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613131779/in/set-72157626364149741/).
*   Followed by "24 bends", a [long series of switchbacks](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613693186/in/set-72157626364149741/).
*   "I smell weed. Or poop." - Shiloh. It was an old man with grandson in lap, smoking weed out of a long skinny pipe.
*   Ladies along the trail [selling bags of weed, saffron and snickers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613107815/in/set-72157626364149741/).
*   7 hours of hiking. Beautiful, amazing views every 5 minutes.
*   Got to [Halfway House guesthouse](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616869468/in/set-72157626364149741). Sat on the deck, had a beer and checked out the view.
*   Alek has a Chinese name: "Overcoming the power of mugwort". He's looking for a new one.
*   Dinner: [two mushroom dishes, eggplant, gung pao](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613714688/in/set-72157626364149741/). Damn.
*   Alek went into the kitchen and found their house-infused baijiao. One was mushroom. Yes, mushroom liquor. The other was olive, papaya, goji berry... and other stuff. Both were surprisingly good.
*   [Closed it out](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5613138331/in/set-72157626364149741/) with biajiao, beer, tea, cards and Snickers.
4/7 Tiger Leaping Gorge to Lijiang

*   Morning hike out, about 3 hours.
*   Tina's Guesthouse is on the road. [Awesome roll-out menu](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616958512/in/set-72157626364149741/), with [qmelettes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616374961/in/set-72157626364149741).
*   Had breakfast of [Shanghai porridge](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616375967/in/set-72157626364149741), [noodle soup](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616961466/in/set-72157626364149741), and [apple pie](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616960152/in/set-72157626364149741) (more like an empanada).
*   Alek took a bus out to the main highway to meet his friend, meeting us in Dali in few days.
*   Shiloh's feet hurt, so she camped out at Tina's.
*   We hiked the down a [scary steep](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616405899/in/set-72157626364149741) "trail" ([which would you choose?](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616396047/in/set-72157626364149741)) into the bottom of the gorge. [Epic nature](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616435125/in/set-72157626364149741/).  [We look happy](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5617121608/in/set-72157626364149741/) because we haven't started hiking back up yet. Well, we can't say we [weren't warmed](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616459875/in/set-72157626364149741/). Too bad it's not high-season, or some old women could've carried us up safely [on one of these](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5617047276/in/set-72157626364149741/).
*   Back up to the top. [Yeah, the gorge is amazing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5616463551/in/set-72157626364149741/).
*   We took a cab to the highway... Alek is there! His bus never came, so he's coming with us Lijiang.
*   AWESOME techno remixes of western pop songs the WHOLE way to Lijiang. I sat in front, so had the best view of the 94 times [we almost died in head-on collisions](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618613199/in/set-72157626372735607/). [The scenery was all rice terraces](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618575139/in/set-72157626372735607/). Wow.
*   Got into Lijiang. It's like an [old Chinese town](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618927727/in/set-72157626372735607/). [Taken over by Disney](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619525266/in/set-72157626372735607/).
*   Checked-in at the guesthouse. [Wonderful decor](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618949691/in/set-72157626372735607/).
*   There's [ba ba](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619516550/in/set-72157626372735607/). [Yak jerky](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619004317/in/set-72157626372735607/). [Yak yogurt](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619517478/in/set-72157626372735607/). [Lots of tea](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618992733/in/set-72157626372735607/). [Dessert](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619522044/in/set-72157626372735607/).
*   Alek took us to a real Nakhi restaurant for dinner. [Huge store of cured pork](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619505950/in/set-72157626372735607/). We drank some [WFSM beer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618919475/in/set-72157626372735607/), had [wild mushrooms](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618920263/in/set-72157626372735607/), some fungus called ["frog skin"](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618921041/in/set-72157626372735607/), [everything soup](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618922897/in/set-72157626372735607/), and [the pork](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618924617/in/set-72157626372735607/). And more baijao. Did I say I loved China yet?
*   Back to the guesthouse, had some [bad wine](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619531936/in/set-72157626372735607/) on the [balcony overlooking the city](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618948063/in/set-72157626372735607/).
4/8 Lijiang, Dali

*   Breakfast of [Nakhi omelet](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619540296/in/set-72157626372735607/) and, yep, [noodle soup](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618951303/in/set-72157626372735607/).
*   Before leaving town, went to Black Dragon Pool. Garden, with a pond that reflects Jade Emerald Mountain. Touristy. But [nice picture op](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619586032/in/set-72157626372735607/).
*   Lunch of [green beans and fermented bean sauce](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619576950/in/set-72157626372735607/), the song er mushrooms (song rong?), and [knife-cut noodles](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5618989793/in/set-72157626372735607/).
*   [We saw Mao](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5619587356/in/set-72157626372735607/).
*   Dali bus was 5 hours long. Longer than we expected. [Great](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620903140/in/set-72157626377062379) [drive](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620310953/in/set-72157626377062379) [though](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620899162/in/set-72157626377062379). Except for the [nasty cat on a leash](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643657534/in/set-72157626377062379).
*   Checked into a guesthouse, and headed into old-town for dinner. Old-town is huge, and touristy, but way cooler than Lijiang. [Castles, yo](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620319979/in/set-72157626377062379).
*   In Dali, [all the food in a restaurant is kept out front](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620905810/in/set-72157626377062379), as advertisement. And [mushrooms!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620318877/in/set-72157626377062379)
*   [More skewers, beer and biajiao](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620320763/in/set-72157626377062379).
*   Went for dessert. Heart shaped chocolate cake... on lettuce. Chocolate parfait... with a cherry tomato. [Apple pie, that was a flavorless apple empanada... on lettuce... with strawberry ice cream](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5643095799/in/set-72157626377062379).
4/9 - Dali

*   Breakfast of bao, black boiled eggs, baba stuffed with carmel sauce.
*   Alec's out, back to Thailand. All three words of Chinese we know will now be put to the test.
*   Somehow it's lunch already. Asparagus, tofu, [emperor oyster mushrooms with dry-cured ham](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620910200/in/set-72157626377062379).
*   Taxi to [the cable car](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620341691/in/set-72157626377062379). Hike from cable car to chairlift is too long, canceling that. Saw [a giant chess set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620400239/in/set-72157626377062379), and [a mirror pond](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621007478/in/set-72157626377062379).
*   Taxi to the chairlift that we didn't hike to. [Beautiful ride](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621012994/in/set-72157626377062379). Look down, oh a grave. Oh look, some more. OHHHHH, thousands of them. [Chairlift mountain forest graveyard](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621014814/in/set-72157626377062379).
*   At the top, we hike to the Higherland Inn, only thousands of steep steps up the mountain. Zero view. WTF. Head back down the trail to the restaurant with a [great view](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621023462/in/set-72157626377062379). The place has [turtles in a tub](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621020410/in/set-72157626377062379)... adjacent to all the food that's on the menu. Hmmm.
*   I got some [wild mushrooms](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620433931/in/set-72157626377062379). Instructions: soak 3 hours, scramble with egg.
*   Did some shopping in the old city, [got some pasta](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620443393/in/set-72157626377062379), and headed back to the hotel to chill.
*   Watched a kung fu movie with lots of flying. Saw a commercial for cleavage pills.
4/10 Dali

*   Banana pancakes and fresh melon for breakfast. Off to Xishuang for cormorant fishing.
*   [Local market](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620449007/in/set-72157626377062379). Saw an [awesome computer store](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621039100/in/set-72157626377062379). [Had noodles](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620470009/in/set-72157626377062379) that were cut off a giant slab that looked like butter. Found the spice they put on the skewers.
*   [Cormorant](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620516951/in/set-72157626377062379) [fishing](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620520205/in/set-72157626377062379/)! [Rowed](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620521725/in/set-72157626377062379). Sang songs.
*   On the way back, taxi driver took us to the obligatory kickback stop, a marble shop. The Chinese word for marble is "stone from Dali".
*   Shiloh chilled at the hotel while [we rode bikes to the lake](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620528969/in/set-72157626377062379/). Stopped at a bakery where they had a "selection of mini sandwiches" on the menu. Turns out the mini sandwiches meant "all sandwiches on the menu, put into one". Fail.
*   Before dinner, got a foot massage, where they had us put our [feet in BOILING water](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620534137/in/set-72157626377062379).
*   Shiloh got a [foot steam bath](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5620534623/in/set-72157626377062379). Shauna: "OK I can smell foot. It smells like a funk dumpling."
*   Saw some locals [smokin' tough](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621119074/in/set-72157626377062379).
*   Hunted down the [wild grilled eggplant for dinner](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621124012/in/set-72157626377062379/) again.
4/11 Back to Kunming

*   Bus to Kunming. Buses here are cheap, and constantly running. Gotta keep your valuables with you. And there's no bus stops, just people waiting on the side of the highway.
*   Another 5 hours on the road. We passed through [Mushroom](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621127772/in/set-72157626377062379) [Town](http://www.flickr.com/photos/autonome/5621128704/in/set-72157626377062379). And went through multi-mile long tunnels.
*   Waited a couple of uneventful hours at the airport, spent our last yuan on tea, and flew home.
