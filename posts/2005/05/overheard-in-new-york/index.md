The subway doors open. A hobo enters, holding a bottle of windex in one hand and a tube of toothpaste in the other. He says: Which is the better time to read Dostyevsky? Winter?

He sprays the windex.

Hobo: Or Spring? 

He squeezes toothpaste out of the tube.

Japanese girl: Spring!  

Hobo: You are correct.

Truly brilliant (and funny as ****) snatches of real life in NYC on this [excellent blog](http://www.overheardinnewyork.com/).
