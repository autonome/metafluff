Here in the Northwest the rainy season is upon us. So, the other day I searched [Craigslist](http://portland.craigslist.org/) and hired someone to clean out the gutters and pressure-wash the roof of our house. They showed up today, and while chatting with them I mentioned that I work on Firefox. Not only had both of these guys heard of Firefox, but they got excited and said that it's their default browser.

Of course, I immediately used the opportunity to do that which is the point of this blog post: Plug Firefox 2.0 :)

*   New theme
*   Anti-phishing
*   Microsummaries
*   Spell-check
*   Session-restore
*   Undo-close-tab
*   Search suggestions
*   Feed handling
*   And 23 other enhancements and bug-fixes (give or take a few thousand)

[Download Firefox 2.0](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/)

Enjoy :)
