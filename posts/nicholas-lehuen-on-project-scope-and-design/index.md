"My point would be the same with any other language, and  

it's not rocket science : keep projects within precise functional  

boundaries, and use carefully designed API whenever you have to cross those  

boundaries. Don't think about building a project that spans those  

boundaries, let people who know how to handle the stuff from abroad handle  

it. If you're interested into changing your scope, then start a new project."[Link]()
