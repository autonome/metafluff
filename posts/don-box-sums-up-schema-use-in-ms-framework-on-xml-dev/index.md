At this point, I believe most SOAP plumbers have conceded that XML  

Schema will be the dominant type system and metadata format for interop.  

How one converts from their local type system to the world of XML Schema  

is a local problem that is (and should be) outside the scope of SOAP.   

In MSFT-land, we do the conversion by importing XML Schema into our  

runtime and making the "foreign" types look local. That technology is  

broadly useful outside the scope of SOAP and/or web services, so we make  

it accessible everywhere, although I'm sure there are lots of customers  

who have no idea this is even in the platform.[Link]()
