"Early 30s is a great time to be alive- you're still young, but you have experience. A powerful combo.  

The downside is all that weird rockstar shit you believe about yourself is well past its sell-by date, and if you haven't outgrown it by then, it starts to curdle your insides."[Link](http://www.gapingvoid.com/favs.htm)
