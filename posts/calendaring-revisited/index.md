Ok, I said I'd come back with a more positive view of calendaring. Here it goes:  

[The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium](http://www.calconnect.org/)  

- "The consortium is focused on the interoperable  

exchange of calendaring and scheduling information between dissimilar  

programs,  

platforms, and technologies." Now *that's* what I'm talkin bout. But  

like any one of these interoperability groups, we'll have to wait and  

see if it has legs.  

[  

The Open Source Application Foundation](http://www.osafoundation.org/) - Led by Mitch Kapor, this group is working on a PIM client that has sharing/syncing built into it's core.  

[iSync in OS X Tiger](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dotmacsync/)  

- Supposedly iSync in Tiger has an extensible architecture that allows  

developers to easily hook into it. Wow, that would be cool if it is  

*actually* open, and doesn't just allow developers to easily hook into  

.Mac...
