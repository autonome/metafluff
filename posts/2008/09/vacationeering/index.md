We stayed on Ambergris Caye in Belize for a week ([pics](http://flickr.com/photos/autonome/sets/72157607081080301/ "Belize pics")), 1/2 mile from the 2nd largest coral reef in the world. We then went overland to see the Mayan ruins at Tikal in Guatemala ([pics](http://flickr.com/photos/autonome/sets/72157607078313286/ "Tikal pics")).

We got stuck in Dallas on the way back, so flew back Monday morning, dropped our stuff off at the house and went straight to Kumoricon, Portland's anime/manga/cosplay convention ([pics](http://flickr.com/photos/autonome/sets/72157607085145227/ "Kumoricon pictures"))!

What a crazy week. Ok, back to work.
