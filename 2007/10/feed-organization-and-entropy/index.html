            <p>I use Google Reader to read feeds. I have a &quot;daily&quot; folder for feeds that I really need to keep up on, and everything else is filed away into about 20 other content-specific folders.</p>
<p>However, I realized that I only read the &quot;daily&quot; folder, and never look in any of the other folders. Ever. And I&#39;m continually paring down the contents of the &quot;daily&quot; folder, as I don&#39;t have time to keep up with those either.</p>
<p>In fact, I&#39;d stopped reading about music, food, art, design, inventions, <a href="http://www.gadget-madness.net/">gadgets</a>, <a href="http://www.clubmogames.com">free mobile games</a>, travel.</p>
<p>In the end, I was basically reading <a href="http://planet.mozilla.org">Planet Mozilla</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Special:Recentchanges">Mozilla wiki&#39;s &quot;recent changes&quot;</a>. And while I love Moz, that&#39;s a far too singular lens through which to vicariously experience life.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m going for the &quot;river of news&quot; strategy: I&#39;ve moved all feeds into the root folder, and will prune from there. I&#39;ve hidden the folder tree (which I wasn&#39;t using anyway), which leaves more real estate for content. I&#39;ve interspersed my work with my play feeds, which will hopefully bring some variety into my digital walkabouts.</p>
<p>I have a followup task: to step away from the computer altogether at some point.</p>
<p>Ack, almost forgot about the &quot;entropy&quot; part of this post! While pruning feeds, I noticed that a bunch hadn&#39;t had any posts in a while. I checked out a few, and found that the feed URL had changed, but the author hadn&#39;t set up redirects, or published any notice at all on the feed. Lame.</p>
