Foxylicious 0.2 is now available.  

This version adds two new features:  

1. Daily automatic updates  

Foxylicious periodically checks to see if a new day has dawned since  

the last update. If it's a brand new day, an update will run  

automatically. This is off by default, and can be enabled via the  

Foxylicious settings page under the Tools menu.  

2. Folder-based sub-categorization by a user-specified delimiter.  

How's that for a feature name! Here's an example: If you  

sub-categorize your delicious tags using a dot syntax (windows.iis,  

windows.monopoly, windows.bsod), you can specify the dot as your  

delimiter, and Foxylicious will create subfolders for each  

sub-categorized tag! I've tested this up to 4 levels deep, and had no  

problems. THEORETICALLY, you should be able to create hierarchies as  

deep as whatever FF's maximum supported folder depth is (ie:  

cosmos.milky-way.solar-sytem.earth.primate.human.female.secretary.tickle-fetish  

- you get the picture).  

Remember: This extension is only 2/10 of the way to 1.0, so if you  

find any bugs, please report them to me (politely) and I'll  

incorporate the fix into the next release.
