[NuSOAP Website](http://dietrich.ganx4.com/nusoap)  

This contains update announcements, API documentation, and links to resources such as the WSDL example provided below.  

[NuSOAP on my weblog](http://dietrich.ganx4.com/index.php?category=NuSOAP)  

This page has links to articles and tutorials about NuSOAP, as well as public examples of usage such as Amazon and Google.  

[WROX NuSOAP Chapter](http://dietrich.ganx4.com/index.php?id=116)  

Probably the most thorough overall guide to using NuSOAP. Doesn't contain WSDL generation information, but has just about everything else. A must-read for any NuSOAP user.  

A thorough example of configuring and enabling wsdl for a server, using both simple and complex types, is available   

[here](http://dietrich.ganx4.com/nusoap/testbed/round2_base_server.phps).  

Once wsdl has been configured for a server instance, it can be generated by appending "?wsdl" onto the endpoint URL.[Link]()
