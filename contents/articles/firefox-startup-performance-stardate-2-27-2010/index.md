Instead of copying around the table of high-priority startup projects, it's now centrally located and updated on the [Startup wiki page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Projects/Startup_Time_Improvements#Active_Projects). A couple of front-end optimizations landed this week:

*   Neil landed [bug 354048](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=354048) to not rebuild toolbars at startup.
*   Ryan landed [bug 522842](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=522842) for the search service to not send notifications until all engines are loaded.
I'll be in Mountain View all next week for the Firefox work-week.
