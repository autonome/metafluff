(11:27:05) me: "I'm writing an application for the Coast Guard Auxiliary that uses your NUSOAP code.."
(11:27:11) me: the coast guard?

(11:28:15) me: those php XXXXXXXs have caused me no end of trouble
(11:28:29) me: the php5 soap impl uses a class name that's the same as nusoap

(11:28:46) me: all with this same error
(11:28:52) me: not only that
(11:29:11) me: the latest version of nusoap (2 years ago or whatever) has it fixed!
(11:29:22) me: which means all these people are downloading an old version from somewhere
(11:29:24) me: OR
(11:29:29) me: are only now upgrading to php5!
