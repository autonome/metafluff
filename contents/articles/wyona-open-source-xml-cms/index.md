"Wyona is just an Interpreter of XML, not just users data, such as for instance articles, press-releases, addresses, but also regarding functionalities, such as for instance access controlling (ACML), workflow management (WFML) and revision controlling (RCML). The concept is similar to the one of a "HTML-Browser". You should be able to switch the Content Management System at any time (who said that?). The network is the Content Management System."[Link](http://www.wyona.org/)
